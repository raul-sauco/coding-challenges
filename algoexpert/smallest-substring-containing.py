# Use a sliding window approach and a counter to keep track of the
# characters and their frequencies that we have inside the current
# window. We iterate over all possible values of the right pointer, when
# we see a character that belongs to small string, we decrease the
# frequency, the number of instances of that character that we are
# short, by one, when the frequency goes from 1 to 0, it means we are
# not missing that character any longer. When we have all characters,
# we record the current window and compare it with the smallest window
# found until then. Once done that, we start shrinking the window from
# the left, when we remove any character in the small string, we add one
# to the number of these characters that we need, if that frequency goes
# from 0 to 1, we add that character to the missing set, as soon as we
# are missing a character, we stop decreasing the window and start
# increasing it.
#
# Time complexity: O(m+n) - We iterate over all characters in the small
# and big string.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We store the frequencies of characters in the
# small string in a counter that could have one entry per character.
