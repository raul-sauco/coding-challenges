# Store the three largest numbers in an array, initialize them with
# -inf, when we see a value that is greater than the minimum in the
# result, update it, then shift the minimum with its next greater
# neighbor until the new value is in its corresponding position in the
# sorted result.
#
# Time complexity; O(n) - We visit each value once and perform O(1)
# operations for each.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant extra memory.
