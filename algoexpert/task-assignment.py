# Sort the tasks on ascending order by cost, use a double ended queue
# to be able to pop from both ends, assign to each worker the next
# easiest and hardest job, that way we optimize the time that each
# worker needs and get the best overall runtime.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting the jobs has the highest cost.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The queue that contains the sorted jobs.
