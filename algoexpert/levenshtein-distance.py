# Compute the changes that we will need to introduce for each
# combination of substrings of both input strings starting at the index
# 0, when the next characters match, the number of edits will be the
# same as without the last two characters that we added. When the
# two last characters do not match, the number of edits will be the
# same as the best between before we added one, or two, of the last
# characters, plus one for the edit needed because the current
# characters do not match.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - Where m and n are the lengths of the input
# strings.
# Space complexity: O(min(m,n)) - Checking which string is longer lets
# us store only one row of extra memory containing the number of
# edits needed when we had one character less of the longer string.
