# to all students, then iterate over the entire array in both directions
# checking student' scores against their neighbors and correcting the
# number of scores that the student with the highest score of the
# current pair will receive.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate twice over the array and perform
# constant time operations.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We use an extra array in memory of the same
# size as the input.
