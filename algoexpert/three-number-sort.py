# Count the frequencies of the digits in the input array, then use these
# frequencies to determine how many positions to update to a given digit
# on the result.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Two passes, one to get the frequencies and one
# to update the positions to their result values.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Only a counter of size 3 of extra memory is
# used, we could also use 3 variables instead, or 2 variables and
# use them combined to compute the third.
