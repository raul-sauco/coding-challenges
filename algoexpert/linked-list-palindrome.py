# Get the length of the list, then traverse to its middle node, or the
# middle point between two nodes for lists with an even number of nodes,
# reversing the first half of the list, then simultaneously traverse the
# tail of the list and the reversed front checking that the node values
# are the same.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We traverse the list twice at most, for each
# node, we do O(1) work.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only store and manipulate pointers.
