# The max profit each day depends on the max profit the previous day,
# whether we are holding stock or not, and the number of transactions
# that we have left.
#
# Time complexity: O(k*n) - The outer loop iterates over n positions
# where n is the number of prices, the inner loop iterates over k
# positions, each iteration of the inner loop computes two values at
# O(1) each.
# Space complexity: O(k) - The dp array has size k.
