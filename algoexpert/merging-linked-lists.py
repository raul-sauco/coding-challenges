# Count the number of nodes on both lists, then skip the difference in
# number of nodes on the longest list and start iterating them at the
# same time, if the lists merge at some point, their tails will be the
# same, if we arrive at the same node at some point, that is the
# intersection, if we don't, the lists do not intersect.

# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of nodes in both lists.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Extra constant memory used.
