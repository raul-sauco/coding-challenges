import timeit


# Use a recursive function that takes in the index of the next character
# that we are assessing, and the string prefix that we have built so far,
# then it checks if the string resulting of adding the current character
# is one of the numbers in the input, if yes, it branches into two, one
# branch checks the result of choosing to make a cut after the current
# digit and one branch chooses to keep building the current string, the
# function returns the best result between both branches.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*m) - Where n is the number of characters in pi
# and m is the size of the numbers array, we iterate over each number
# in pi inside the branch function, and we can split into m calls to
# branches.
# Space complexity: O(n+m) - The call stack can have a max height of n,
# the numbers set has one entry per element in numbers.
