# Use an array of len == capacity + 1 where each item represents the
# maximum value that we can put in the knapsack when the knapsack's
# weight is equal to the position's index, for example dp[4] has the
# maximum profit found at the moment for a knapsack weight of 4 units.
# We iterate over the items, for each, we do a nested loop over all the
# values of capacity in reverse, from capacity to 0, what we are trying
# to do is check if we could add the item that we are visiting to a
# previous combination of items to come up with the weight k, if we can,
# we then check if using this new combination would result in a better
# profit, still for the same weight k, if it would, we then record this
# new "winning" combination in dp[k]. This problem has the added concern
# over the typical knapsack problem that they require us to store the
# indexes of the items that we are using, we can do that using a tuple
# of (int, List[int]) instead of a plain int as the values in dp.
#
# Time complexity: O(c*n) - Where c is the capacity given in the input
# and n is the number of items. For each item, we need to iterate the
# entire dp array, with c+1 positions. We could improve the complexity
# sorting the items array by weight and breaking out of the inner loop
# earlier, but we would need to store then the original element's index.
# Space complexity: O(c) - We store an extra array of size capacity.
