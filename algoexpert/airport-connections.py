# Start by marking all airports as unreachable, use the airports and
# routes to create an adjacency list that represents the graph and
# create a queue/stack of airports that are reachable but we have not
# visited yet. Start by adding the starting airport plus any airports
# that do not have any incoming flights to the stack. Then we start
# processing airports. For each airport on the stack, we recursively
# visit all their neighbors marking them as reachable, any time we
# run out of airports to visit, we pick one of the unreachable airports
# and add one to the count of flights that we need to add, then start
# visiting neighbors for that airport recursively. The result is the
# sum of airports that had no incoming flights, and were added at the
# beginning, plus the ones that were added when we run out of airports
# to visit during the DFS.
#
# Time complexity: O(r + a^2*log(a))
# Space complexity: O(r + a) - The adjacency list will have r entries, the
# missing set and stack could grow to size a.

# I do not have a proof for the correctness of this solution and I
# actually think that it is incorrect and we could create test cases
# that make the tests fail, even so, it is an interesting solution and I
# thought that it made sense saving it and look into its correctness
# later. It does pass the tests in AlgoExpert at the current date.
# The solution marks airports as visited using the list of airports that
# have been visited and their adjacency list to visit all airports that
# are reachable, since we know that flights that have no incoming flights
# will need a flight to them, we add them directly. Then we iterate
# over the remaining unreachable airports sorted ascending by number of
# incoming flights and descending by number of outgoing flights, that is
# to say, we prioritize airports with less incoming and more outgoing
# flights, and process them one at a time, marking all airports we can
# reach from them as reachable. This code may not always be correct but
# it is a much more efficient solution than the previous one and it
# could be an effective way to solve the problem with large inputs and a
# solution that is close enough to the optimal one.
#
# Time complexity: O(r + a*log(a)) - Sorting the unreachable airports by
# in and outdegree and traversing the routes to create the adjacency
# list are the most expensive steps, then we use at most O(n) to add
# and travel to the rest of airports because add each airport a maximum
# of one time to the stack.
# Space complexity: O(r+a) - The adjacency list will have r entries, the
# missing set and stack could grow to size a.
