# This problem can be seen as a variation of two sum, we can use the
# same approach, iterate over the input checking if the reverse of the
# current word has been seen, if yes, add it to the result set,
# otherwise, add it to the set of words that we have seen. We could
# remove a word from the set to clean up after we find its match,
# depends on if we want the code to run faster or to be cleaner.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of characters in the
# input.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The set of seen words can grow to the size of
# the input.
