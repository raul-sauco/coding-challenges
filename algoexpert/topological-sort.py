# Implement a classical example of topological sort.
#
# Time complexity: O(j+d) - First we iterate over all the dependencies d
# to create the dictionaries, then we iterate over all jobs j, and in
# a nested loop again over all their dependencies (still d).
# Space complexity: O(j+d) - The dependents dictionary has size d, the
# dependencies dictionary only holds one integer per job.
