import timeit
from typing import List


# Iterate over the sorted queries computing the total linear waiting
# time of the queries run up to that point, each query has been waiting
# that amount of time, add its waiting time to the combined waiting time
# of all queries. Since the queries are sorted, the longest query will
# be the one that we want to run last, we want to execute faster queries
# earlier to minimize the waiting time.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting has the highest complexity.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Sorting in python takes up to n/2 memory in
# the worst case, even though is O(1) in the best case.
