# We know that we need to place a queen in each row, and each queen also
# needs to go in its own column and diagonals, if we try to place queens
# in rows by order, and keep three sets to determine in O(1) which
# columns and diagonals are free and which ones are under attack, we
# can quickly find paths that will not lead to a result and abandon
# them. To determine which paths we have explored already, and which
# ones we haven't we can use the row/column values and a backtracking
# function.
#
# Time complexity: O(n!) - Though in reality the number of operation
# will be much better than that.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We store 2*n elements in the diagonal sets
# and n elements in the columns set.
