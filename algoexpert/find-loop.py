import timeit


# Use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare cycle detection algorithm. The tortoise
# and the hare start at the same time and move at different speeds until
# they intersect. Once the two pointers intersect, make the tortoise
# point to the head of the list and slow the hare to the same speed as
# the tortoise, keep iterating until they intersect again, that
# second intersection point is the first node in the cycle.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We will visit the nodes a linear number of
# times.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant extra memory used.
