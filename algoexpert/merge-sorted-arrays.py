# Use a heap to store the first unused element of each array together
# with its position in the array and the array position in the input.
# This gives us all the smallest unpicked elements in a heap, which lets
# us pick the next smallest element in O(log(k)) where k is the number
# of lists in the input, and also the number of elements in the heap.
# When we pop an element out of the heap, we add it to the result, since
# we know that it is the next smallest element, and we check if the list
# it came from has any more element, if it does, we add the next element
# to the heap.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(k)+k) - We pop n elements from the heap at a
# cost of log(k) each, we also build a list with the first item on each
# list at a cost of k.
# Space complexity: O(k+n) - Where k is the number of lists in the input
# and n is the total number of elements in the input. The heap has size
# k and the result array that we build gradually has size n.
