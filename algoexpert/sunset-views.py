# direction to traverse the input. Store the height of the tallest
# building we have seen up to the moment, traverse all the buildings in
# the reversed order to where they face, when we see a taller building,
# we add it to the result set.

# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element in the input once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The result list can grow to the same size as
# the input.
