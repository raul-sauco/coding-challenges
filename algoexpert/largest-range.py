# The obvious solution would be to sort the input and remove duplicates,
# then iterate over the sorted input counting the length of contiguous
# sequences.

# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting has the highest complexity.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Sorting in Python takes up to n/2 memory.

# We can use a hash set and a two pointer approach, create a set of all
# numbers in the input, then start iterating over all the contiguous
# ranges that we can find removing them from the set, to do it, first we
# pop one value from the set and use two pointers to travel left and
# right until we arrive at a gap in the contiguous values, when we have
# computed the current range, check if it is the largest that we have
# seen and move onto the next.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate twice over all elements in the
# input doing constant work. If we knew the max value of any element in
# the input, we could improve the algorithm using an array instead of
# the hashmap, saving the cost of hashing.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The hashmap.
