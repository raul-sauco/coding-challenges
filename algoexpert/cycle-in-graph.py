# The nodes can have three states, not visited yet, visited and visited
# along the current path that we are exploring, if we ever visit a node
# that we have already seen in the current path, using depth-first
# search, we have found a cycle and we can immediately return True, if
# we process all nodes without finding a cycle, we can return False. We
# need three states for the nodes because the problem does not guarantee
# that the graph is connected, if we pick one node and complete dfs from
# it, we have no guarantees that we have visited all nodes in the graph.
#
# Time complexity: O(v+e) - We will visit all nodes and travel all edges.
# Space complexity: O(v) - The call stack could grow to the size of the
# input graph.
