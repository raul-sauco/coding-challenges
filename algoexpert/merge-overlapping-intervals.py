# Sort the intervals by start and then iterate over them, before adding
# an interval to the result, we check if it overlaps with the last one
# already in the result, if it does, we update the end time of the last
# interval in the result to be the max of its own end time and the end
# time of the current interval.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - For the sorting, once sorted, checking
# the intervals can be done in O(n).
# Space complexity: O(n) - Sorting takes space in Python. The result set
# can also be of the same size as the input, but I would not consider it
# on the space complexity calculation.
