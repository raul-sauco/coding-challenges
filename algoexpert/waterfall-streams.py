# Simulate the water flow through the matrix, when we hit an obstacle,
# try to flow left and right, discard flows that get interrupted.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n^2) - Where m is the number of rows and n is the
# number of columns in the matrix, we iterate over all rows, for each
# row we visit all positions checking if they contain water, if they do,
# we may check n positions in the matrix until we find where the water
# will fall or decide that it gets stuck.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We store n values in memory.
