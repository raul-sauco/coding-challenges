# currencies that we can obtain, every time that we best the amount of
# one currency, use it to check how many of all other currencies we
# could potentially buy using the new amount.
# TODO: Check the solution that uses Bellman-Ford, it may be better.

# Time complexity: O(n^3) - The outer loop goes over n elements, the
# middle loop iterates over all currencies that have been updated in
# the last iteration of the inner loop, the inner loop iterates over all
# currencies checking if we can use the updated amount of base currency
# to obtain more of this currency than previously we thought it was
# possible.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The exchange array x has length n and the
# updated set will grow to n-1 in the first loop, because all other
# currencies will be updated.
