# Classic two sum problem, the most common solution is to use a set to
# check if each number complementary has been seen in O(1).
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate once over the input and do O(1)
# operations for each element.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The set could grow to the same size as the
# input.
class HashSet:
    def twoNumberSum(self, array: List[int], targetSum: int) -> List[int]:
        # A set of integer values that we have seen.
        seen = set()
        for num in array:
            if targetSum - num in seen:
                return [targetSum - num, num]
            else:
                seen.add(num)
        # If the sum cannot be obtained with two numbers, return an
        # empty list.
        return []


# A different solution that sacrifices time to gain a better space
# complexity, first sort the array, then use two pointers to try to
# compute the target using a small and a large value.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - The sorting step has the highest
# time complexity, the two pointer section that visits the elements is
# O(n).
# Space complexity: O(1) - The algorithm does not use any extra memory.

            # sum, move the left pointer right.
            if s < targetSum:
                l += 1

            # sum, move the right pointer left.
