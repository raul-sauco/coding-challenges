# The naive solution would visit each block and compute the distances to
# all required facilities without taking into account any of the
# previous calculations, that would be O(n^2*r) with n the number of
# blocks and r the number of requirements. We can improve that using a
# greedy approach, we do one pass left to right computing the distances
# that we need to walk from each block to each requirement if we went
# west from the blocks, if a block has that requirement, the distance
# is 0, otherwise, the distance equals the distance from the previous
# block + 1, we can do that in O(n*r), then we do the same going
# right to left and checking if we can get to any of the facilities
# quicker walking east, if we can, we update the value, we also compute
# the maximum distance that we need to walk from the current block to
# the furthest away facility inside this loop and keep a variable with
# the best block to move into.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*r) - Two passes over the blocks checking all the
# requirements for each.
# Space complexity: O(n*r) - We keep a list of size n with each entry
# a dictionary of size r where the values are the distance to the
# closest required facility from the given block.
