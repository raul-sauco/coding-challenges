# splits it and merges it.

# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - This could actually be higher if
# slicing the array takes O(n) per call.
# Space complexity; O(n)? - Python garbage collection supposedly cleans
# after each call, at any one time, the call stack will be using:
# O(n) + O(n/2) + O(n/4) + O(n/8) ... => O(2n) => O(n) space, instead of
# the O(n*log(n)) that intuitively could seem.

# work derived from slicing the array.
