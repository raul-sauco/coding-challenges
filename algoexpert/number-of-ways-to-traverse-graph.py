# We can look at this problem as computing the ways to arrange m "R" and
# n "D" in a string of length n+m, where m is the width of the graph and
# n is its height, at each position we can choose to go either right or
# down until we have consumed all the moves. When we look at the problem
# that way, it is easy to see that it can be expressed as a classic
# combination problem; the problem of traveling a graph of w: 4, h: 3,
# from its top-left corner to its bottom-right corner only moving down
# or right at each step, is the problem of choosing where to place two
# "D"s in a string of 3 "R"s and 2 "D"s, which is C(5,2) (C(5,3)).

# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - the factorial function is calculated as:
#
# > factorial(n) is written in the form 2**k * m, with m odd.  k and m
# > are computed separately, and then combined using a left shift.

# Python3 factorial implementation and comments:

# Space complexity: O(1) - But the result of factorial grows at a O(n!)

# Bottom-up DP. We initialize a row of size m with all values being
# equal to 1. This represents the possible ways to reach the destination
# from these positions. Then we iterate over the remaining rows of the
# matrix updating the possible ways to reach the destination from the
# given position.
#
# For each position, the possible ways to reach the destination are the
# sum of the position above plus the position to its left.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We do one calculation for each position of
# the matrix mxn.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We store an array of size n in memory.
