import timeit


# Start by sorting the disks, then iterate over the disks in an outer
# loop, for each disk, iterate over all other disks checking if we could
# add the second disk below the first one, if we can, we check if using
# this combination gives the highest height we can obtain while using
# the second disk. We keep a variable with the highest "tower" that we
# have been able to build and the index of the last disk we added, for
# each disk, if we get a better combination, we save both the new max
# height we can have when having this disk as the bottom of the tower,
# and the disk that we would have above it. Once we have processed all
# disk combinations, we get the tallest combination by starting at the
# tallest bottom disk and following the indexes back towards the top of
# the tower.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - For each disk, we compute the result of
# adding it above every other disk.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We have 2 arrays that are both size n.
