# Tags: String - Two Pointers

import timeit


# Determine which string is longer, if any, and start iterating over all
# the indexes in both of them at the same time, if we find a character
# that is not the same in both strings, we consume one edit and keep
# checking the characters after the edit.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the length of either string, if
# the lengths differ by more than 1 the algorithm will stop in O(1).
# Space complexity: O(1) - Only constant extra memory is used.
