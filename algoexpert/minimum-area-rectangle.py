# Create two hashmaps of all points indexed by their x coordinates in
# one and by their y coordinates in the other one. We get a sorted list
# of all x coordinates that contain any points, and start iterating over
# them from left to right, for each coordinate, we get a sorted list of
# all the y points at that x coordinate and start iterating over any
# possible combination of two with y1 being the lower one and y2 being
# the higher one, for any y2 value, we iterate over all x values in that
# axis, now we have all the coordinates that we need to construct a
# rectangle and we just need to check if the last point exists in O(1).
#
# Time complexity: O(n*m) - Where m is the maximum number of points in
# a given axis. Worst case all the points are in the same axis and we
# end up iterating over every single pair in O(n^2), average case is
# probably something like O(n*log(n)) where the points are evenly
# distributed and we don't have many points in the same axis, best case
# would be O(n) and it would be when each x and y axis contain a maximum
# of 2 points, in that case we would only visit each point once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Both hashmaps have as many entries as points
# there are in the input array.
