# One intuitive solution tries to find rectangles choosing one of its
# corners as the starting one and then traveling clock, or counter, wise
# over all the other vertices. The vertices are easy to find because
# we know that they are in the same axis as their neighbors. To make
# sure that we do double count rectangles, we can use a set that
# contains a sorted tuple of 4 tuples.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - For each coordinate, we visit all other
# coordinates, once we have two, we can find the other two coordinates
# faster.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionaries will contain all points in
# the input.

# We can make the code more readable using the observation that, if we
# find two points situated in different x and y axis, they could form
# two opposite corners of the rectangle, then we could check if their
# matching corners exist in O(1). If we sort the points and iterate over
# them using two nested loops, we can consider the first point the
# bottom left and check if the second could be the top/right, which
# means that both its x and y value need to be greater than, if it can,
# then we check if the two matching corners exist. This algorithm
# prevents duplicates because we only iterate over each combination of
# bottom/left and top/right points once.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We iterate over all combinations of two
# points in the input.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The hash set contains all the points in the
# input. We use it to find the third and fourth points in O(1). If we
# could not use extra space, we could find these points in O(log(n)) in
# the sorted array, giving an overall time complexity of O(log(n)*n^2).
