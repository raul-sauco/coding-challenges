# When we want to calculate shortest paths in a matrix, one of the best
# algorithms is BFS, we can make it even more efficient if we do BFS
# from both the end and the start.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Breadth-first search will process nodes one
# level at a time, it could visit all cells in the grid.
# Space complexity: O(log(n)) - The queue will hold at most log(n) cells
# at one time, one level.

# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - With n the number of cells in the grid,
