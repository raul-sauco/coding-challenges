import timeit
from typing import List


# From each cell in the grid, compute the number of paths that start
# there, store already computed cells to avoid computing them multiple
# times.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We visit each cell in the grid, for each, we
# call the recursive function, the function only runs once per cell, if
# the number of paths from that cell has already been computed, it will
# return that value in O(1).
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The size of the dp matrix.
#
# Runtime 1690 ms Beats 100%
# Memory 32.3 MB Beats 96.12%
