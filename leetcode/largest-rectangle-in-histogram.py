# Use a min monotonic stack where each entry is a tuple (height, index).
# While correct, this implementation fails to pass the tests because it
# computes the rectangle between all the heights in the stack and a
# newly added height each time one is added. The next solution shows how
# we can avoid doing this O(n^2) work.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - In the worst case, we keep pushing new
# heights into the stack without popping any, at O(n) per push.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We store all heights in the stack.
#
# Fails with Time Limit Exceeded.

# Use a monotonic non-decreasing stack. Add boundary 0s to the start and

# extended to include this positions. The left 0 boundary also
# guarantees that the stack will never be empty, letting us avoid having
# to check in each iteration of the inner loop. Iterate over the heights
# array, when we see a height smaller than the top of the stack, we pop
# it and calculate the rectangle that can be obtained between the
# popped height and the first smaller height to its left. We keep the
# largest area found to return as the result of the function.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate once over the input array, each
# height can be, at most, pushed into and popped from the stack once,
# and we calculate an area every time we pop from the stack, that is a
# maximum of n area calculations.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack can grow to the same size as the
