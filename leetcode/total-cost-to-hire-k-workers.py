from typing import List


# Use two priority queues with c candidates each, pick the k candidates
# with the smallest cost form each of the queues.
#
# Time complexity: O(k*log(c)+n) - We push and pop into the heaps k +
# candidates items if there are enough in the input array, each push
# and each pop cost log(candidates). Creating the deque is O(n)
# Space complexity: O(c+n) - Each of the heaps stores candidates entries
# the deque has the same size as the input.
#
# Runtime 787 ms Beats 81.76%
# Memory 27 MB Beats 82.28%
