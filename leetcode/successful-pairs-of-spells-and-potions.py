# Use the built-in bisect function, since we want to guarantee that
# spell * potion >= success, which is equivalent to potion >=
# ceil(success / spell) we can use bisect_left to find the position at
# which we would insert potion.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)+m*log(n)) - Where m is the number of spells
# and n is the number of potions. We sort the potions array at nlog(n)
# cost, then iterate over the spells, for each spell, we binary search
# the number of potions that can be combined with the spell to result in
# a successful combination.
# Space complexity: O(m+n) - Sorting the potions array of n positions
# can take up to n/2, the result array has size m.
