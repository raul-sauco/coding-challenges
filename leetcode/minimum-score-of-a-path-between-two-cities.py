# Use a modified version of union find that, each time that connects
# components, it also keeps the value of the min value edge that has
# been seen between the two components that are being connected and the
# new edge that is being added, then return the minimum edge of the
# set that contains node 1, since we are guaranteed that 1 and n are
# connected, this set also contains n.
#
# Time Complexity: O(e) - Where e is the number of edges, we iterate
# over the edges and, for each, we do a union operation that runs in
# amortized O(1) time.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of nodes, we have three
# structures of size n.

# Runtime 1679 ms Beats 85.57%
