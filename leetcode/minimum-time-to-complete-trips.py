import timeit
from typing import List


# Use binary search to take guesses on the time that it can be needed
# for the n buses to complete k number of trips.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(k*t)) - Where n is the number of buses,
# k is the total number of trips to be completed and t is the time
# that the fastest bus needs to complete one trip.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Only pointers used, unless the list
# comprehension takes memory, in that case O(n) but it could be improved
# to O(1) using sum directly instead of the list comprehension.
#
# Runtime 1679 ms Beats 99%
# Memory 28.3 MB Beats 96.75%

        # The minimum and maximum possible time to complete k trips.
        l, r = 0, totalTrips * min(time)
        # Binary search the answer.
        while l < r:
            guess = (l + r) // 2
            # Can the buses complete k trips in guess amount of time?
            if sum([guess // req for req in time]) >= totalTrips:
