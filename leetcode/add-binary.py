# Time complexity: O(max(m,n)) - Where m and n are the lengths of a and
# b, we will iterate as many times as characters on the longest input
# string.
# Space complexity: O(max(m,n)) - The list of resulting bits will have
# as many elements as digits on the longest input string plus possibly
# one more.

# Runtime: 76 ms, faster than 18.20%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 25.36%
