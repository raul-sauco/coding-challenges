# Iterate over the input list nodes in groups of size k, for each group
# we iterate twice, first to check if we have enough nodes to form a
# section of size k and, at the same time, to get a pointer to the first
# node after the next section of size k. We keep a pointer to the node
# right before the section that we are reversing and the one right after
# that section, then we use an auxiliary function to reverse the section
# and return its head and tail, we link the previous node with the head
# of the reversed section and the tail of the reversed section with the
# first node after it.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node twice.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant memory.
#
# Runtime: 93 ms, faster than 63.67%
# Memory Usage: 15.2 MB, less than 85.27%
