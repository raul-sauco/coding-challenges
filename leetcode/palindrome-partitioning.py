import timeit
from typing import List

# Classic backtracking solution, for each index, we try all string
# prefixes to see if they are a palindrome, if they are, we use them to
# build one of the solutions (one of the ways to partition the input
# string) and keep building starting at the first unused index.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*2^n) - The decision tree splits in 2 at each
# level, and there are n levels where n is the number of characters in
# the input string. At each call, we iterate over all characters in
# the substring, which could also be n, to check if the substring is
# a palindrome.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The height of the call stack, if we take into
# consideration the result, then n^2 which is the possible number of
# palindromes.
#
# Runtime 658 ms Beats 85.74%
# Memory 30.3 MB Beats 47.4%
