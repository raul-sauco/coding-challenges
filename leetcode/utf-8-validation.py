# Iterate over the input converting the integer to string
# representations of their 8 less significant bits. When a single byte
# character is found, move to the next one, when a multi-byte character
# is found, check that the next bytes match the expected format.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of integers in the input.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.
#
# Runtime: 115 ms, faster than 94.59%
# Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 96.64%
