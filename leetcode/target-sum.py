# Top down memoization solution using a dictionary as the memo object.
# each calls shifts the index one position forward and returns the
# result of the recursive call adding both the positive and negated
# value under the current pointer to the result.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We are avoiding calculating results that we
# have already stored in the memo, we will compute results for the same
# index and sum only once, there are approximately n^2 over the size of
# the nums input combinations of index and sum.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - The memo will have one call for each of the
# possible combinations of index and current sum.
#
# Runtime: 973 ms, faster than 29.34%
# Memory Usage: 41.7 MB, less than 9.68%

# 2D Dynamic programming solution.  We could use a 2D array of size n*t
# where n is the number of elements in the array nums and t is all the
# possible values that the sum could take, that is all the values
# between [-sum(nums), sum(nums)], each row represents the index of nums
# that we are visiting and each column represents a value, the cells
# represent how many different ways we have of arriving at that value.
# On each iteration, we use all the values on the previous row to
# compute the ways to calculate the values on the current row given the
# current value nums[i], we would return the value at index target on
# the last row.

# We can optimize the space usage of the proposed 2D Dynamic programming
# solution if we keep a dictionary of value: ways to sum up to it, then
# iterate over the items in nums, for each key in the dictionary, which
# represent a value that we could sum up on the previous iteration, we
# add its count to two values in the new dictionary, key+nums[i] and
# key-nums[i] because we could choose to add or subtract this value,
# then we update the dp dictionary with the values just computed before
# visiting the next index. The result is the value at index target after
# we visit all indexes.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*t) - Where n is the number of values in the input
# array nums and t is the number of values that the sum can take, or
# [-sum(nums)...sum(nums)].
# Space complexity: O(t) - Where t is the number of values that the sum
# can take, all values in [-sum(nums)...sum(nums)].
