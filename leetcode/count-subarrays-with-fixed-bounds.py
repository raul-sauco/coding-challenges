# The most brute force solution picks every combination of start and end
# indexes and iterates over all the elements between the indexes to
# check if the array has fixed bounds.

# Time complexity: O(n^3) - Three nested loops.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant extra memory.

# The key observation to make is that out of bounds elements cannot
# belong to any subarray, we can split the input into subarrays that
# could be subarrays with fixed bounds. If we keep track of the indexes
# of the last time that we saw an out of bounds value, a max and a min
# values, we can compute the number of subarrays in O(1) from any index.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate over the elements one time and do
# constant time work for each.
# Space complexity: O(1) - The algorithm uses constant extra memory.

# Runtime 871 ms Beats 83.60%
# Memory 28.5 MB Beats 69.75%
