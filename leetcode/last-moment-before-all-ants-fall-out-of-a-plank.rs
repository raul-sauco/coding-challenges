    /// When ants collide, they turn around but, if we ignore their labels, it
    /// is effectively the same as ignoring each other, the result of a collision
    /// is still one ant going in each direction at the same speed, and with the
    /// same position as before the collision. We just need to find how long it
    /// takes the leftmost and to fall off the right edge, and how long it takes
    /// the rightmost and to fall off the left edge, and return the max between
    /// these two values. We iterate both input vectors to find the maximum value
    /// in left and the minimum value in right. If the input vectors were sorted
    /// we could just pick the last and first and return the result in O(1)
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(m+n) - Visit each element in both vectors to find
    /// the maximum of left and minimum of right.
    /// Space complexity: O(1) - Constant extra memory used.
    ///
    /// Runtime 0 ms Beats 100%
    /// Memory 2.14 MB Beats 100%
