# Convert the arrays to strings using join() then compare them.

# Time complexity: O(m+n) - The sum of the length of each string.
# Space complexity: O(m+n) - The strings that we cast the arrays to.

# Runtime: 61 ms, faster than 46.31%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 75.82%

# We can improve on the previous solution by defining a generator
# function that produces the characters of a given List[str] in order.
#
# Time complexity: O(min(m, n)) - The algorithm will run at most the
# length of the shorter input counting characters.
# Space complexity: O(1) - No extra space is used, the generator does
# not store all values in memory but only uses a constant amount of
# memory.

# Runtime: 62 ms, faster than 43.12%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 33.11%
