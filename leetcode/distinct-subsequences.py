import timeit

# The brute force solution simply chooses to use or skip each character
# in s until the string that is being built is of length t, then returns
# whether the string constructed is a match or not.
#
# Time complexity: O(2^n) - Where n is the length of s.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Where n is the length of s, the call stack
# can grow to height n.


# We can improve the previous solution caching intermediate results to
# avoid repeating the same calculations and by only moving forward when
# the characters under both indexes are a match, otherwise only move
# forward the s pointer trying to find a match for the character in t.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - The potential number of combinations of the
# internal function parameters.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The number of call results that could be
# cached equals all the different parameters with which the function
# could be called.
#
# Runtime: 105 ms, faster than 97.19%
# Memory Usage: 19.6 MB, less than 76.97%

# The dynamic programming solution stores the ways to build up to

#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We iterate over each index of t, in reality
# over an average of half the indexes of t, but it does not change the
# overall time complexity, for each index of s.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - We store a value for each combination of
# m and n.
