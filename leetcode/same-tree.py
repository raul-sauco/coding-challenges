# Recursive approach. For each node, check that their values are the
# same and the left and right subtrees are also the same.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We could visit each node of the input.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The memory used will be the call stack, if
# the tree is balanced it will closer to O(log(n)).
#
# Runtime: 24 ms, faster than 98.30%
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 72.95%

# the tree is balanced it will closer to O(log(n)).
