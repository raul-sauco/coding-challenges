# One way to go about solving this problem is to visit each position in
# the matrix and checking what is the longest increasing path that we
# can take from there.
#
# Time complexity: O(4^(m*n)) - At each point we can take a maximum of 4
# different choices.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The seen dictionary and the call stack can
# both end up holding all the matrix elements.

# Once we realize that we are not required to keep track of the cells
# that have been visited, because any cells with values greater than the
# current cell, the only ones that we want to visit, could not have been
# visited previously in the strictly increasing path, since their value
# is greater than the current cell's, the problem becomes much simpler
# and easier to memoize, we only need to store the longest combination
# that can be built from any (row, col) combination.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We will compute the path from each cell only
# once, once we have it, it gets cached.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - We are storing one path value for each cell
# in the matrix.

# Construct a directed acyclic graph using the elements in the matrix
# based on the possible travel between cells given the constrains of the
# problem. Iterate over the matrix storing the indegree of a given cell
# in an auxiliary matrix, use a q to do BFS, add all elements with a 0
# indegree to the queue in this iteration. Then start visiting adjacent
# cells using BFS while keeping track of the path length. When we visit
# a cell, we decrease their indegree by 1, once it reaches 0, we add it
# to the queue to be processed.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We visit each cell once during preprocessing
# and once during BFS.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The auxiliary matrix is the same size as
# the input, the queue could grow to the same size as the input.
