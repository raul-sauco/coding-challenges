    /// dp(i,j)= x represent the maximum number of substrings that we can use
    /// while keeping a maximum of i zeroes and j ones. For each substring in
    /// the input array of substrings, we iterate over all the keys, a maximum
    /// of 1e4, checking if we could add the number of zeroes and ones to the
    /// current dictionary entry without going over the limits m and n.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(m*n*s) - Where s is the length of strs. We iterate
    /// over all strings s and, for each, we iterate all the existing keys in
    /// the dp dictionary. m and n are limited to 100, we could simplify to
    /// O(s*1e4) â‰ˆ O(s) but, in the context of the problem is a big enough
    /// that I think it is more accurate to not simplify. We could go even
    /// further and, since len(strs) <= 600, and that is also a small value,
    /// O(100*100*600) â‰ˆ O(1)
    /// Space complexity: O(m*n) - The dp dictionary.

    /// Runtime 21 ms Beats 100%
    /// Memory 2.3 MB Beats 100%
