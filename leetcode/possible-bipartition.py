# Use depth-first search to visit nodes related to any unassigned pair.
# A solution using BFS would be almost the same but using a queue
# instead of the stack in the inner function to queue nodes.
#
# Time complexity: O(n+e) - We iterate over all nodes once, for each
# node, we visit all the edges.
# Space complexity: O(n+e) - All the structures have a linear relation
# to the number of nodes in the input, except for the adjacency list
# that holds a list of outgoing edges for each node.
