impl Solution {
    // This solution is based in two observations, words with the same first
    // letters can never be combined amongst themselves, because they would
    // not change and therefore are guaranteed to be in the input, we can
    // put all words with the same characters into sets. Then we iterate over
    // each pair of sets, check how many word suffixes are common between
    // both sets, because they will also result in an existing word, and
    // compute the number of ways to combine suffixes that are not common
    // between themselves.
    //
    // Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each word to build the dictionary,
    // then iterate over the characters that we use as keys for the
    // dictionary using a nested loop at O(26^2)â‰ˆO(1). Inside each of the 26^2
    // loops we compute the intersection of sets, which overall can be at most
    // O(n) work because that is the number of words in the combined sets,
    // and do some math with the length of the sets and their intersection
    // at O(1).
    // Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionary contains all characters in the
    // input.
