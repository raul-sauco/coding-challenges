# For either house, we choose to take it, and skip the next one, or to
# skip it, leaving us free to take the next one. We can start designing
# the brute force solution.
#
# Time complexity: O(2^n) - For each element in the input array, we can
# make two decisions.
# Space complexity: O(2^n) - The call stack will grow to accommodate 2
# calls per each item in nums.
#
# This solution would fail with Time Limit Exceeded. Even so, we can use
# it as a building block for better solutions because it will help us
# decide the steps needed to solve the problem without introducing any
# extra complexity.

    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Define a recursive function that returns the best result of
        # stealing from the houses from an index forward.
        def dfs(houses: List[int]) -> int:
            # Base cases, if we have no houses left to visit, return 0.
            if not houses:
                return 0
            # If we only have one house, return its value.
            if len(houses) == 1:
                return houses[0]
            # Otherwise, call the function for the two options that we
            # have at the current position:
            # - We can rob this house, add its value to the counter and
            #   calculate the best of the array left after
            #   we remove this house and the next.
            # - We can skip this house and return the best of the array
            #   left after removing it.
            # Return the best result.
            return max(houses[0] + dfs(houses[2:]), dfs(houses[1:]))

        return dfs(nums)


# We can replicate the logic of the brute force solution, but memoize
# partial results. To make memoization easier, instead of slicing the
# array on each call, we can pass the index of the house at which we
# want to start checking.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We only calculate the best results once per
# index of nums.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack can only have n calls on it.

            #   we remove this house and the next.
            # - We can skip this house and return the best of the array
            #   left after removing it.
            # Return the best result.
            result = max(nums[idx] + dfs(idx + 2), dfs(idx + 1))
            memo[idx] = result

        return dfs(0)


# We can apply the same idea, as in the brute force solution, to
# calculate if we would get the best profit by robbing, or skipping a
# house, but use dynamic programming instead of recursion. The previous
# solutions gave us a clue to the fact that we can determine the max we
# can rob by either taking the house and the accumulated total skipping
# the next house or by skipping the current house and taking the
# accumulated total at the next house.
#
# best[i] = max(nums[i] + best[i + 2], best[i + 1])
#
# We can easily build a bottom-up dynamic programming solution based on
# that. In this particular problem, it is easy to turn it around to
# obtain a top-down solution as well:
#
#   best[i] = max(nums[i] + best[i-2], best[i-1])
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We can use the input array to calculate.
#
# Runtime: 24 ms, faster than 99.53%
# Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 20.34%

        # At index 0 we don't have any choices, at index one we either
        # take house 0 or 1:

# We can improve on the top-down solution by storing the most amount of
# loot in two variables instead of updating the values on the input array.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use a constant amount of memory.
