# We can obtain the largest number converting the 6 with the highest
# order into a 9, if none are found, then it is optimal to not modify
# the input.
#
# Time complexity: O(1) - We iterate 3 times over the input, converting
# to a list of strings, finding the first 6 and casting back to int.
# Since the input has a maximum of 4 digits, time is bounded.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Where n is the number of digits in the input,
# we create a list of digits. Since the input has a maximum of 4 digits,
# space is bounded.
#
# Runtime: 38 ms, faster than 84.45%
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 54.69%

# Use divmod inside a loop to find the index of the furthest left 6 in
# the input, then add 3 at that position to update that value to a 9.
#
# Time complexity: O(1) - The loop will execute a maximum of 4 times
# because num <= 10^4.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.

# Runtime: 67 ms, faster than 10.70%
# Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 9.69%
