# Definition for a QuadTree node.
class Node:
    def __init__(
        self, val, isLeaf, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight
    ):
        self.val = val
        self.isLeaf = isLeaf
        self.topLeft = topLeft
        self.topRight = topRight
        self.bottomLeft = bottomLeft
        self.bottomRight = bottomRight


# We can create an internal function that takes the boundaries of a
# section of the input matrix, can be the entire matrix, and returns the
# quad node that represents the root of the section. One way to do it
# would be to iterate all the cells in the given section checking if
# they all contain the same value, if they do, the current node is a
# leaf. Another way to do it, is to recursively divide the grid in
# nodes until we get to sections of size 1, which by definition must be
# leaves, then start reconstructing the tree from the roots, when a node
# has all leaf children and they all have the same value, that node
# becomes a leave itself.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We will visit each cell in the matrix once.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - We may create a node for each cell in the
# matrix. The call stack will be log(n) as well but that is simplified.

# Similar approach to the previous solution but, instead of creating a
# node instance for each leave, we create two, false and true, and
# reuse one of them for each leave node.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We will visit each cell in the matrix once.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - We may create a node each for non-leave
# cell in the matrix, which still has a linear relation with the number
# of cells, even though we are reusing nodes for leaves.
