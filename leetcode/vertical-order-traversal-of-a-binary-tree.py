# We can use a dictionary of dictionaries to store col => row => [values]
# We can do a tree traversal, for example preorder, keeping the node
# values together with their row and column, as we visit the nodes, we
# add their values to the row and column list that corresponds them.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node of the tree adding them to
# their column/row position in the dictionary. Then we need to sort the
# column keys before iterating through them, then sort the row entries,
# and, if a column/row position has multiple entries, sort them, this
# all costs O(n*log(n)) over the number of entries that we are sorting,
# but that number of entries, number of column, number of rows and
# number of values in the same column/row, can grow at most at a
# O(log(n)) over the number of nodes ratio, therefore, the overall
# complexity is bounded to O(n).
# Space complexity: O(n) - The nested default dictionaries have a max of
# n nodes as leafs.

# Runtime: 57 ms, faster than 41.65%
# Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 28.65%
