import timeit
from typing import List


# We can use dynamic programming, this problem is similar to the classic
# coin change problem, we can keep a dp object where the entries
# dp(i,j)= x represent the maximum number of substrings that we can use
# while keeping a maximum of i zeroes and j ones. For each substring in
# the input array of substrings, we iterate over all the keys, a maximum
# of 1e4, checking if we could add the number of zeroes and ones to the
# current dictionary entry without going over the limits m and n.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n*s) - Where s is the length of strs. We iterate
# over all strings s and, for each, we iterate all the existing keys in
# the dp dictionary. m and n are limited to 100, we could simplify to
# O(s*1e4) â‰ˆ O(s) but, in the context of the problem is a big enough
# that I think it is more accurate to not simplify. We could go even
# further and, since len(strs) <= 600, and that is also a small value,
# O(100*100*600) â‰ˆ O(1)
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The dp dictionary.

# Runtime 1856 ms Beats 95.59%
