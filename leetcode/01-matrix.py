# Use BFS and a matrix with the current shortest distance between any
# cell and land to compute the shortest distance between any cell and
# land, we will only process cells the first time that we land in them
# because the level keeps increasing.
#
# Time complexity: O(m+n) - We will visit m*n cells.
# Space complexity: O(m+n) - The distance matrix has the same size as
# the input matrix, m rows and n columns.
#
# Runtime 654 ms Beats 73.33%
# Memory 17.3 MB Beats 41.48%
