# The perfect squares will remain on after n number of toggles, we can
# compute the number of perfect squares as the floor of the sqrt of n.
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - I believe that sqrt in Python is log(n).
# Space complexity: O(1) - I believe that sqrt uses constant space.

# Sqrt is pretty slow because it is trying to find an accurate solution,
# since we are only trying to find the floor of the solution, we can
# try to use binary search.
