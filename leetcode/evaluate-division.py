# Use the equations and values to construct an adjacency list, when we
# get a query, compute the shortest path between src and dest.
#
# TODO: Make a more robust version of this solution, a union find
# structure could be used to quickly determine if the nodes are
# connected. BFS is guaranteed to return a correct answer because the
# description tells us that there are not contradictions, if we obtained
# a different result going through another path, that would be a
# contradiction and would break that premise.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*(e+v)) - Where n is the number of queries, e is
# the number of edges and v is the number of nodes, vertices. For each
# of the n calls to bfs, we run a BFS over the entire graph that could
# visit v vertices and e edges. We could improve this storing results or
# computing the distance between all nodes once and storing that in a
# matrix. It would be necessary if the search space was greater.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The adjacency matrix will have the same
# number of entries as the equations and values arrays times 2.
#
# Runtime 44 ms Beats 31.85%
# Memory 16.4 MB Beats 25.75%
