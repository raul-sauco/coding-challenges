    /// visited nodes and the length of the path taken to get there. We use that

    /// neighbor, if the path resulting of traveling there is the shortest path
    /// to that node having that set of visited nodes along it, then store that
    /// result in the dp array. The 2D dp array stores the shortest paths to
    /// each state, and it is used to avoid cycles. A state is represented by a
    /// n bits bitmask, with bits set for the nodes that we have visited along
    /// the path, and the index of the last node along that path.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n*2^n) - When we pop elements from the queue, we check
    /// if we have visited the same state before, if we have, since we are doing
    /// BFS, the path would have been shorter, and we can stop exploring the
    /// current path, that means that the number of elements that we will push
    /// into the queue is capped by the size of the dp matrix.
    /// Space complexity: O(n*2^n) - The dp matrix uses the most extra memory.

    /// Runtime 0 ms Beats 100%
