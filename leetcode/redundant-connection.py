# We can use union find to put elements into disjoint sets, if we find
# an edge between two components that are already in the same set, that
# edge is redundant.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once, union find runs in
# amortized O(1)
# Space complexity: O(n) - The parents array will grow in size linearly
# with the size of the input.
#
# Runtime: 112 ms, faster than 41.16%
# Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 92.03%

        # No need to return anything, the problem guarantees that there
        # will be one, and only one, redundant node, we found and
        # returned it inside the for loop.
