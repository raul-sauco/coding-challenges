# A very intuitive solution is to recursively pick the first element of
# the current array as the root of each (sub)tree, then call the
# function again to build the left subtree with elements smaller than
# the root, and the right subtree, with elements greater than the root.
# This solution is easy to read and understand but its time complexity
# suffers because, for each time that we pick one value as a root, we
# copy all other values into two separate arrays.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - Each time that we pick one single value as
# the root of one tree, or subtree, we copy all the remaining values n
# into one of the two subarrays.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - Each call to bstFromPreorder has its
# own full copy of the input, and in average there will be O(log(n))
# calls, but there could be as many as O(n).
#
# Runtime: 67 ms, faster than 65.88%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 52.59%

# For anyone that has previously solved the problem "Construct binary
# tree from preorder and inorder traversal", we can directly reuse that
# solution given that the problem gives us the preorder and the inorder
# of a BST results in a sorted list of node values.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting the values to obtain the
# inorder traversal result has the highest cost.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The inorder array will grow to size n, the
# call stack will, in average be of log(n) height, though it could reach
# a height of n in an unbalanced tree.

# We can also use an iterative approach, create the root node of the
# resulting tree and push it into a stack, then start iterating over the
# remaining elements of the input. When we see an element that is
# smaller than the last element seen, append it as the left child of
# that element and push it into the stack, when we see an element that
# is greater than the top of the stack, keep popping until we find an
# element with a value greater than it, then append the current node as
# the right child of the last element we popped and push the new node,
# not the last popped element, into the stack.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once and push it/pop it
# to/from the stack a maximum of one time each.
