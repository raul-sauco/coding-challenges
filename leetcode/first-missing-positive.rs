    /// The input constraints mean that, either the input vector contains exactly the first n
    /// integers between 1..=n or one or more of them are missing, either way, we do not care
    /// about any values except one instance each of these integers, anything else we can ignore,
    /// for example duplicates, negative numbers, zero and anything bigger than n. We iterate over
    /// the input, each time we find a value x in the range 1..=n we move it to the index x-1,
    /// unless the value there is already x, once we complete that loop, each index i will contain
    /// the integer i+1 if it was found in the original input, we iterate over the mutated input
    /// vector and return the first nums[i] where the value is not i+1, if we get to the end of the
    /// vector without having returned anything, it means that it contains exactly the values 1..=n
    /// and we know that the first missing positive is n+1, we can return that value.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n) - Even though we have a nested while loop inside the for loop, all it
    /// does is move a positive integer in the valid range to its position by index, each value
    /// is moved at most once so the inner loop runs n times, it could run multiple times for one
    /// iteration of the outer for, but that would mean that it does not need to run in the same
    /// number of other iterations of the for loop.
    /// Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant extra memory by using the input vector to mark
    /// elements seen.
    ///
    /// Runtime 6 ms Beats 63%
    /// Memory 2.88 MB Beats 99%
