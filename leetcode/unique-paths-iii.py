# One way to solve this problem is to use depth-first search, the two
# points to keep in mind are:
# - We need to be able to determine which cells we have visited already
#   in order to avoid visiting them again.
# - We need to be able to determine if we have visited all the empty
#   cells, once we reach the destination, to decide if the path taken is
# a valid path.
# We can solve the first problem updating the value of the cells when we
# visit them, then resetting it when we backtrack. To determine if we
# have visited all empty cells, we can count them before we start the
# depth-first search, then simply keep count of the number of cells that
# we have visited along the current branch of the dfs.
#
# Time complexity: O(3(m*n)) - At each step we can take up to three
# different paths, not four because we can never go back to the cell
# that we came from.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The call stack can grow to the size of the
# input grid.
#
# Runtime 46 ms Beats 98.34%
# Memory 13.8 MB Beats 93.68%
