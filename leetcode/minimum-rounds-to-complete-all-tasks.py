# We need to count the number of tasks of each difficulty, then greedily
# group them in as many groups of 3 as possible with 0, 1 or 2 groups of
# 2 at the end to place the remainder of freq % 3 if any. We can use
# Counter to group the tasks by difficulty, then divide by 3 to obtain
# the number of groups, if there is any remainder to the division, we
# need to add one more group to the result.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once, then iterate over
# the frequencies that will be, at most n.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The counter can grow in size with the input.
