# Start at all the cells from which the water can flow directly to the
# Pacific, push them into a set and a deque, start processing the queue
# checking if the water can flow from the neighboring cells to the
# North, East, South and West into the cell that we are visiting, for
# cells where it can, push them into the set and the queue.
# Once we are done with the Pacific, do the same with the Atlantic.
# Return the intersection of the sets converting tuples to lists.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element 1 or 2 times.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The queue and the set may grow to the same
# size as the grid.
#
# Runtime: 270 ms, faster than 99.03%
# Memory Usage: 15.5 MB, less than 78.43%
