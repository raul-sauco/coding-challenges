# Compute the Manhattan distance between all pairs of points, and store
# it in a list, heapify the list based on distance between points then
# start popping edges from the heap, if the two vertexes, points, at the
# ends of the edge we pop are not connected, we connect them and add the
# edge's weight to the result. We can use the union find algorithm to
# detect if the edges are connected and to connect them if they aren't,
# this algorithm should be efficient because we greedily choose the
# edges with the least weight and use them to build disjoint sets of
# points that we can connect as soon as an edge between them appears.
# We know that this edge will form part of the minimum spanning tree
# because we explore edges with less weight first. We can stop the
# algorithm as soon as we find n-1 edges, where n is the number of
# points.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - Finding the distance between all vertexes is
# the step with the highest complexity. Heapify is O(n) and popping from
# the heap O(n*2log(n)) because we pop n-1 times and the size of the
# heap is n^2 hence each pop is 2*log(n).
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - The heap contains (n-1)^2 edges.

# Runtime: 958 ms, faster than 99.8%

# Use Prim's algorithm, start choosing any point in the set, mark all
# the other points as not visited. While there are points unvisited,
# calculate all the Manhattan distances between the current point and
# all the unvisited points and add them to the heap, then pop any
# distances with a destination point that has already been visited, use
# the first distance to an unvisited point to mark that point as visited
# and the next current point and add the edge to the total weight of the
# MST. Once there are not remaining nodes to visit, return the result.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - While there are remaining nodes, we compute
# all the distances between the current node and the unvisited nodes,
# this means that we end up computing the distances between all nodes,
# same as with Kruskal's algorithm. Pushing and popping from the heap
# is more efficient because it contains less edges in average.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - The unvisited set contains n-1 nodes, the
# heap could contain (n-1)^2 edges though in average it will contain
# less than that because in each iteration we only add n-1 edges max and
# we pop some of them.
