# Explore the tree using DFS, consider each node two different ways,
# as the root of a tree and as part of a path. Compute the maximum path
# sum for each of these situations, use the maximum path sum as the root
# of a tree to update a global result variable, and the maximum path
# value as part of a path to return to the caller, parent, node, since
# the parent will use this value to compute its own maximum values.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We will visit each node on the tree.
# Space complexity: O(h) - The call stack will reach the same height as
# the number of levels on the tree, if the tree is balanced it will be
# O(log(n)), if it is skewed, it will be O(n).
#
# Runtime: 87 ms, faster than 96.22%
# Memory Usage: 21.3 MB, less than 63.83%
