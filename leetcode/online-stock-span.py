# Use a monotonic stack, each element contains the price and the number
# of consecutive days at which the stock was at a price not greater than
# that price on that day. When we add a new element, we start the count
# of days at one, the current day, then check the stack and pop any
# elements where the price is smaller adding the number of consecutive
# days at, or below, that price, to the current count. Then add the
# current price and result to the stack and return the result.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Average cost for the next method is O(1), some
# calls may be more expensive, but the total calls to stack.append and
# stack pop will be n where n each is the number of calls to next.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack may hold all prices if they are
# non-increasing.
#
# Runtime: 923 ms, faster than 58.78%
# Memory Usage: 19.4 MB, less than 70.93%
