  /**
   * Use depth-first search starting from every node, keep visited nodes in
   * a set to make sure we only visit each node once. Keep also a hashmap
   * of sets that we have visited along the current path pointing to the
   * position along the path at which we saw them, if we see a node that we
   * already saw in the current path, we have found a cycle, the size of
   * the cycle is the difference between the two positions at which we
   * found the current node, if we get to a node that does not have any
   * outbound edges, we can return 0 because the path will not have any
   * cycles.
   *
   * Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once and do O(1) work,
   * once a node is visited along one path, we will not visit it from
   * another path, if a path leads to a node that was visited already, it
   * will stop there.
   * Space complexity: O(n) - The list of visited nodes and the dictionary
   * of nodes seen along the path can both be of size n.
   *
   * Runtime 99 ms Beats 39%
   * Memory 87.1 MB Beats 35.14%
