# A very similar problem to LeetCode 567. Permutation in String, create
# a hashmap of character frequencies in p, then start iterating over a
# window of s of the same length as p using the hashmap to check if the
# sliding window contains exactly the same characters, and in the same
# frequency as p, to slide the window, we add the character to the right
# and remove the one to the left from the frequencies dictionary.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of characters in s, we
# iterate over all characters in s and do O(1) work for each.
# Space complexity: O(1) - The input strings can only have English
# lowercase letters, the frequency dictionary can grow at max to 26.
