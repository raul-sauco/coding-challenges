# Use a sliding window moving the right pointer forward while the sign
# is the opposite sign than on the previous two elements, when the
# condition fails, we adjust the left pointer to either, the current
# element, if the element is equal to the previous one, or the previous
# element if it is greater or smaller than the previous element, we
# also keep a variable with the last sign that we have seen that we use
# to check that the next one is the opposite sign.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once and do O(1) work.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant extra space used.

# Runtime 493 ms Beats 83.81%
