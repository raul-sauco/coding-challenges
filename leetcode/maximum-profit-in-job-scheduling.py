# The brute force solution first creates a list of jobs sorted by start
# time, then a depth-first recursive function explores the different
# branches resulting from choosing to schedule or skip the jobs.
#
# Time complexity: O(2^n) - On each level the recursive tree splits into
# two branches.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack can grow to a height of n.
#
# This solution fails with TLE even when using memoization.

# job that could be scheduled when we choose to schedule the current job
# instead of skipping it. We store the best result for each index on the

# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We compute the max starting at each
# index only one time, for each, we search the next job that can be
# scheduled using binary search, O(log(n)).
# Space complexity: O(n) - Boh the cached results and the call stack
# will grow to the same size as the number of jobs in the input.

# Use the same idea as on the memoization solution but reverse it to
# compute the maximum profit up to a given point in time starting from
# the jobs that we can schedule first. We sort the input jobs by end
# time, then iterate over them saving the maximum profit that we can
# make up to a given time t, if we can improve on the current maximum
# profit by scheduling this new job, we schedule it by recording the new
# maximum profit and the current job end time on the dp array. Since
# we are iterating over the jobs based on end time, we are guaranteed to
# have a sorted dp array, that lets us use binary search to find the
# last job we can keep if we decide to use the current one.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We iterate over all jobs, for each, we
# do binary search on the dp array to find the maximum profit before the
# start time of this job.

# input.
