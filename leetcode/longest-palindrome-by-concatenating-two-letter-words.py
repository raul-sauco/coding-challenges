# We can create a dictionary of words that we have seen and how many
# times we have seen them, when we see a new word, we check if we can
# use it to build a palindrome by reversing it and checking it against
# the dictionary, if we can use it, we "consume" its palindromic entry
# from the dictionary and add 4 to the result.
#
# For example, if we have {'ab': 1} in the dictionary and we are
# evaluating 'ba', we remove one entry from 'ab' from the dictionary and
# add 4 to the result count. Note that in this case, removing 1 count
# of 'ab' removes the entry completely from the dictionary.
#
# Once we run out of words, we check the dictionary for a palindrome key
# that we have not consumed, for example 'aa', if we find one, we add 2
# to the result set, because we could use it to build the palindrome
# around it.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each character in the input once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionary can grow to the same size as
# the input.
#
# Runtime: 1707 ms, faster than 71.76%
# Memory Usage: 38.3 MB, less than 87.66%
