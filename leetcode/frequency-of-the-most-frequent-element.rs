    /// Sort the input, I sorted it in reverse, because I thought it would be easier to reason
    /// about the sliding window algorithm that way, but in the editorial they sort ascending and
    /// it ends up being very similar. Use a sliding window to visit sections of the array, grow
    /// the window while the number of operations needed to make all elements equal to the
    /// greatest one is <= k, after that, start sliding the window to see if there is any greater
    /// window to the right. We don't need to shrink the window because we are only interested in
    /// the largest window, once we find a window of size n, we are not interested in finding any
    /// other unless they are of size >= n.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - For the sorting step, after that, the sliding window
    /// algorithm runs in O(n)
    /// Space complexity: O(n) - The mutable copy of the input, if we mutate the input instead,
    /// then it would be O(1)
    ///
    /// Runtime 21 ms Beats 89.16%
