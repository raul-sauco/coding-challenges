import timeit

from utils.binary_tree import BinaryTree, TreeNode


# The inorder traversal of a BST will return the nodes sorted by their
# values, we can use that property. We perform the inorder traversal
# comparing each node's value to the previous one while saving the
# minimum difference seen up to that point. Once we have visited all the
# nodes, we return the minimum difference seen.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node and do constant time work
# for each.
# Space complexity: O(h) - Where h is the height of the tree, the stack
# will grow to the height of the tree, which could be equal to n.
