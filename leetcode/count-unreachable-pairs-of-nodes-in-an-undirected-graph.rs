     * A really nice problem, combinations and union find! The number of pairs
     * that cannot reach each other equals the total number of pairs, that can
     * be computed as C(n, 2) = n * (n-1) / 2, minus the number of pairs of
     * nodes that can reach each other, to compute the number of pairs that can
     * reach each other, we can compute the number of disjoint sets and their
     * size, for each disjoint set of size m, we can subtract the number of
     * pairs in that disjoint set C(n, 2) from the total.
     *
     * Time complexity: O(n+e) - Where n is the number of nodes (n) and e is
     * the number of edges, creating the data structures of size n requires
     * n time, as does creating the set of representatives and, in the worst
     * case, iterating over the set of representatives could be O(n), if no
     * vertices where connected (e == 0). Creating the union find structure
     * requires O(e), we iterate over all edges and do amortized O(1) work
     * for each.
     * Space complexity: O(n) - The parents and rank structures are O(n), the
     * representatives set would be O(n) is the worst case.
     *
     * Runtime 65 ms Beats 100%
     * Memory 15.6 MB Beats 100%
