# Traverse all edges creating two structures, an adjacency list and an
# array of indegrees, starting at each node that has an indegree of 0,
# meaning that it could be the root of a tree in the forest, depth-first
# search to travel all paths of the current tree, each node returns a
# list of length 26 with the highest path frequency of each color in the
# subtree rooted at the given node.
#
# Time complexity: O(e+v) - Where e is the number of edges and v the
# number of vertices, we iterate all the edges and may iterate all nodes
# for each we iterate over all neighbor's and colors 26.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack may hold n calls, each call
# returns an array of size 26.
