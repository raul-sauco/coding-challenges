import timeit
from collections import Counter
from typing import List


# Create an adjacency list of the given graph that we know is a tree,
# use the list to do a depth first search where nodes return the
# frequencies of labels in the subtree that they are the root of, a
# parent adds its own label to the frequencies of all children, uses
# the counter to obtain the frequency of its own label and update the
# result array with it and returns the frequency counter to its parent.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Each node is visited once, for each visit, we
# do O(1) operations.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack will grow to the height of the
# tree, which could be n, each call receives 2 parameters and returns a
# dictionary of max size 26.

# Runtime 3041 ms Beats 74.36%
