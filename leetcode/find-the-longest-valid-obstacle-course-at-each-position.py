# Use dynamic programming, each subproblem can be seen as "the longest
# non-decreasing subsequence" but, if we use something similar to the
# LIS solution, it will run in O(n^2*log(n)), we can instead see that,
# for each index, we only need to find the longest sequence to the left
# where the last element is less than, or equal to the current element,
# because then we can append the current element. We could do this in
# O(n), resulting in O(n^2) overall time complexity, iterating over all
# the previous results but that can be optimized if we use an extra
# structure where we keep these previous results sorted and can binary
# search the insertion point.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We iterate over all the elements, for
# each, we do a binary search over the previous results that could be up
# to n.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dp array uses n extra memory.

# Runtime 1025 ms Beats 31%
