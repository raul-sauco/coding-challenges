# Use an extra stack of memory and simulate the operations that took
# place, push the next element, then, while the top of the stack matches
# the next element that needs to be popped, pop it.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element on the pushed array and
# do amortized O(1) for each.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack can grow to the same size as the
# input.

# Runtime 57 ms Beats 99.86%
# Memory 14.1 MB Beats 85.31%
