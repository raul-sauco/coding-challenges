import timeit
from collections import defaultdict


# A very similar problem to LeetCode 438. Find All Anagrams in a String.
# We can use the same technique: use a hashmap to keep track of
# characters that we need vs characters we have seen, negative values
# denote characters in s1 that we haven't found in s2 yet, positive
# values denote characters that we have seen in s2 but aren't, or not in
# the same frequency, in s1. When we have the same frequency of the same
# character, we remove the entry from the dictionary. We use a sliding
# window of size s1 to iterate over s2 adding the newly seen right
# character and removing the left. If at some point the frequency
# dictionary is empty, we have a full match and can return True, if we
# get to the end of s2 without a match, we can return False.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of characters in the s2
# we iterate over all characters in s2 and do O(1) work for each.
# Space complexity: O(1) - The input strings can only have English
# lowercase letters, the frequency dictionary can grow at max to 26.
#
# Runtime: 61 ms, faster than 98.26%
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 94.40%
