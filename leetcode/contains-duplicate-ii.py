# We can keep values that we have seen in a hash map with their index
# as a value, we iterate over the entire input checking if the index of
# the last time we saw the same value is within range.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We process each element once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The hashmap can grow to the same size as the
# input.
