}

/// Use two hashmaps, one to store travelers in transit information, it will
/// save an entry when a traveler starts a trip with the traveler's id as the
/// key and the station and time as the value. When a traveler checks out, it
/// will use all the data to compute the travel time and insert it into the
/// times hashmap under the (start_st, end_st) key, if the key already exists
/// in the hashmap, it will update the values. When we need to get the average,
/// we access the times hashmap and use the total traveled time and number of
/// trips to get and return it.
///
/// Time complexity: O(1) - Each call to any of the methods is processed in
/// constant time.
/// Space complexity: O(n) - We could have as many entries in the travelers
/// hashmap as calls to the check_in method, but most likely that number will
/// remain low, as entries are removed by calls to the checkout method. The
/// number of entries in the times hashmap could be equal to the number of
/// total trips, if every combination of in_station and out_station was unique.
///
/// Runtime 34 ms Beats 92.86%
/// Memory 17.1 MB Beats 100%
