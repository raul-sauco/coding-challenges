import timeit


# Iterate over characters in word1 and word2 alternatively until we
# consume one, or both, of them. If we have only consumed one of them,
# append the remainder of the other to the end of the result.
#
# Time complexity: O(m+n) - We iterate over all characters in both input
# strings.
# Space complexity: O(m+n) - We store all characters in extra memory.
#
# Runtime 27 ms Beats 90.33%
# Memory 13.8 MB Beats 55.13%
