from typing import List


# We can use memoization, starting at each city, we can decide to visit
# any other city, including ones that we have visited previously, any
# time we reach the destination, we could stop there, and that would be
# one of the possible routes, but we can also keep going. If we run out
# of fuel, we return 0 to represent that the branch did not lead to a
# route, even though it could have included some possible routes if it
# went through the finish location at some middle point.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - Where m is the number of locations and n is
# the number of different values that the remaining fuel could take, and
# could be equal to the initial fuel. Once we have computed m*n calls to
# dfs, any possible result will be stored in the cache and calls would
# be solved in O(1)
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The size of the cache.
#
# Runtime 2055 ms Beats 63.16%
# Memory 33.9 MB Beats 31.58%
