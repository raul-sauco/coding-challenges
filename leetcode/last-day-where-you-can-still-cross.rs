    /// we do a linear search for the last day in which it would be possible to
    /// cross, the complexity would be O((m*n)^2) which we can reduce using
    /// binary search to find the same day.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(m*n*log(m*n) - We use binary search to find the last
    /// day in which is possible to cross. The search space is the number of
    /// days from the first day, in which no cell is water, to the last day, in
    /// which all cells are water, which makes it equal to the number of cells.
    /// Each time we test if we can cross in a given day, we are creating a
    /// new matrix with the cells at that given day O(m*n) and then doing
    /// BFS in that matrix, which is also O(m*n)
    /// Space complexity: O(m*n) - The matrix we create inside the can_cross
    /// function is m*n. We also map the cells vector to a vector of usize
    /// tuples, the resulting copy also has size m*n.
