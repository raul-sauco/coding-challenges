# Use a modified version of Dijkstra where instead of storing one only
# distance to each node in the graph, we store a multidimensional array
# of best distances having used k stops. As we Dijkstra, we use a heap
# to explore shorter paths first but in this case, we can visit the same
# node multiple times, as long as the number of stops is different,
# because a more expensive route may require less stops and it may lead
# to the solution.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Creating the adjacency list can be done
# in O(n), where n is the number of flights, but exploring the graph may
# lead to each flight being pushed and popped from the heap in O(log(n)).
# Space complexity: O(n) - All the flights will be stored in the
# adjacency list, and the heap may also grow to size n, for example if
# we could visit all the cities from the origin.

# pursuing it any longer. All that means that we can use BFS to explore
# one level at a time, we start by flying from the source to all
# available destinations, then, from all of them to all the ones that
# we can reach from there and so on, if the price to get to a destination
# is greater than a price that we have seen before, with least stops, we
# discard that branch, if the price of a trip becomes greater than the
# cheapest way to get to dst found so far, we discard it as well, we
# run the BFS algorithm k+1 times, then return the solution or -1.

# Time complexity: O(n*k) - The outer loop runs k times, the inner loop
# will average n items maximum because we only enqueue elements when we
# find a cheaper path in a later iteration.

# flight information in the adjacency list.
