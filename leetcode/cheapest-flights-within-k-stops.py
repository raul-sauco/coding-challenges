# Use a modified version of Dijkstra where instead of storing one only
# distance to each node in the graph, we store a multidimensional array
# of best distances having used k stops. As we Dijkstra, we use a heap
# to explore shorter paths first but in this case, we can visit the same
# node multiple times, as long as the number of stops is different,
# because a more expensive route may require less stops and it may lead
# to the solution.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Creating the adjacency list can be done
# in O(n), where n is the number of flights, but exploring the graph may
# lead to each flight being pushed and popped from the heap in O(log(n)).
# Space complexity: O(n) - All the flights will be stored in the
# adjacency list, and the heap may also grow to size n, for example if
# we could visit all the cities from the origin.

# Runtime: 449 ms, faster than 38.94%
# Memory Usage: 16.5 MB, less than 6.89%
