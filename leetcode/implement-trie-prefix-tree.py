# Create a class that directly implements all the required methods, the
# class internally uses dictionaries to store and find each node
# children, including the root.

# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of characters in the
# input word. All methods have the same complexity, for each character
# in the input, we do a dictionary access in O(1).
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - Where m is the number of words and n the
# average number of characters per word, each character could take space
# in the trie, even though often that will not be the case because
# characters shared between words will only take space once.

# Runtime: 144 ms, faster than 96.10%
# Memory Usage: 27.5 MB, less than 92.13%
