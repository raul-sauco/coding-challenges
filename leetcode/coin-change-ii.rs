     * Use an array of the same size as amount plus one where each position
     * stores the number of different combinations that we have to build up
     * to that amount. We initialize the array with all zeroes except for
     * i == 0 that we initialize at 1 to represent that there is one way to
     * make up 0, not choose any coins. Then we iterate over the coins, for
     * each coin, we iterate over all the positions in dp from coin to the
     * end, the number of ways we can get there is the number of ways
     * currently plus the number of ways that we can get to i - coin, because
     * we can use one of these coins to get there from i - coin and we can do
     * that in as many different ways as we can get to i - coin.
     *
     * Time complexity: O(m*n) - We iterate over the number of coins and, in
     * the inner loop, over coin..amount.
     * Space complexity: O(n) - The size of the dp object.
     *
     * Runtime 0 ms Beats 100%
     * Memory 2 MB Beats 77.78%
