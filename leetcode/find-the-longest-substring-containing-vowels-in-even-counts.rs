    /// the possible 32 (2^5) combinations of values, store in an array the first position at which
    /// we saw it. Initialize the array with the value 31 "11111" pointing to the position before
    /// the start of the array => -1. To simplify things, I will use 0 and then shift forward all
    /// the other indexes by 1.
    /// We then iterate over the characters in the input string, compute the current running xor
    /// and check if it has been seen before, if yes, the vowels are all in even pairs between any
    /// index we have seen the same xor at, we are only interested on the first one because it will
    /// give us the longest substring, and the current one, we max that value with the current max.
    /// If we have not seen this xor before, we store it pointing to its current position.
    /// I have used usize::MAX to flag uninitialized array elements, using Option<i32> set no None
    /// would have been better, and using i32 for the position would have let us use the non
    /// modified indexes, which would make the code more readable, but I choose this way to save on
    /// some casting to usize to use as indexes.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element and do O(1) work for each.
    /// Space complexity: O(1) - We store an array of 32 elements and 2 usizes, all in the stack.
