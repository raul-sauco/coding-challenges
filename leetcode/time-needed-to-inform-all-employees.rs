    /// Time complexity: O(n) - Recreate the tree, we could use tree nodes, but
    /// in Rust is quite verbose so I opted for an adjacency list instead, once
    /// we have a way to navigate from parents to children, the problem becomes
    /// a simple tree traversal, we can use BFS or DFS while keeping track of
    /// the time required to reach every employee, and return the maximum.
    /// Space complexity: O(n) - The subordinates vector is a 2D vector, but it
    /// will only have a total of n entries because each node is limited to
    /// having only one parent, we know the total number of edges = n-1.
