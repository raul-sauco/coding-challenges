# Iterate over the input, greedily use ladders saving the gap sizes we
# bridge using ladders in a heap, once we run out of ladders, every time
# we see a positive height gain, compare with the top of the heap, if
# the top of the heap is smaller, pretend we used bricks to save that
# gap and we still have one ladder to bridge the current one, until we
# run out of bricks.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We visit each element in the input, for
# each, we may push and pop from the heap in O(log(n))
# Space complexity: O(l) - The heap can have as many entries as the
# number of ladders.

# Similar to the previous solution but "use bricks" for each gap we
# encounter until we run out of bricks, saving them all in a max heap.
# Once we encounter a gap that we cannot bridge using bricks, substitute
# the greatest gap found so far for a ladder, keep doing that until we
# are out of ladders and we don't have enough bricks to bridge the next
# gap or we get to the end.

# for each, we may push and pop from the heap in O(log(n))
# Space complexity: O(n) - The heap can have as many entries as the
# elements in the input.
