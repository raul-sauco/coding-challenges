# The problem is just asking for the topological sorting of the
# dependencies graph. This is similar to Course Schedule I but, instead
# of returning if it is possible to complete all the courses, we add
# them to a list as we order them and return it.
#
# Time complexity: O(n+p) - We iterate over the courses in O(n) to
# create the dictionaries, then iterate again over them as we are
# popping them from the queue and check all their dependencies, if we
# call p the number of edges in the graph, we will iterate over n + p.
# Space complexity: O(n+p) - We store nodes and edges in the
# dependencies dictionary.
#
# Runtime: 125 ms, faster than 77.63%
# Memory Usage: 15.6 MB, less than 61.66%
