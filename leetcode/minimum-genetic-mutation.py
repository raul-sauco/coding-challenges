# This problem could be solved like Word Ladder, creating a dictionary
# of patterns: matches to save time finding neighbors, but given the
# small constrains of the description, it is doable, and simpler, to
# explore the entire bank searching for neighbors for each sequence that
# we visit.

# With the given input constrains, almost any approach is guaranteed to
# be efficient enough. This solution uses DFS, it checks the bank for
# any neighbors of the start word and recursively calls minMutation
# with that neighbor as the new start and having removed it from the
# list.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - Where m is the number of characters in each
# sequence and n is the number of sequences, since they are both limited
# to 8 and 10 respectively, it is equivalent to O(80) - O(1).
# Space complexity: O(n) - The height of the call stack, limited to 10
# and so equivalent to O(1).
#
# Runtime: 34 ms, faster than 90.83%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 86.98%

# We can also use BFS, which would become more and more efficient vs the
# DFS solution as the size of the input grows. Since we are trying to
# find a minimum distance between two nodes, and DFS will explore each
# branch all the way to the end before moving to the next branch, while
# BFS will explore all the nodes that we can reach at depth 1, then move
# to depth 2 and so on, stopping as soon as we arrive at the minimum
# distance. With a large enough input, it could be worth it to explore
# using BFS from both ends, which would improve performance and it is
# feasible given the problem.
