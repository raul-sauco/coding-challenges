# Use dynamic programming, visit all the indexes of both strings, for
# each, the LCS equals the LCS of the previous indexes plus one if the
# characters match, or the best of removing one of the characters if
# the characters at the current indexes do not match.

# Time complexity: O(m*n) - Where m and n are the lengths of the input
# strings.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - We use a matrix of m*n positions.

# Neat solution that was on the faster end of the submissions, it
# creates a hashmap of chars to indexes at which they have been seen,
# then uses the hashmap to quickly determine if they can be used to
# build a longer sequence.

# Time complexity: O(m*n) - O(n) to build the dictionary, then we
# iterate over the m characters of text1 and, for each, may end up
# iterating over all the indexes on text2, if that was the only
# character found there. Even though the theoretical complexity is high,
# the actual runtime is very good because the input strings tend to
# have low frequencies of different characters instead of high
# frequencies of few characters.
