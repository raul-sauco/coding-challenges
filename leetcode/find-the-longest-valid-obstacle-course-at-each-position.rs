    /// where the last element is less than, or equal to the current element,

    /// the previous results but that can be optimized if we use an extra
    /// structure where we keep these previous results sorted and can binary
    /// search the insertion point.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We iterate over all the elements, for
    /// each, we do a binary search over the previous results that could be up
    /// to n.
    /// Space complexity: O(n) - The dp array uses n extra memory.
