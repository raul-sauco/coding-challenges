# Use a 2D array to store the LPS between two indexes l and r that we
# have already computed, the base case is when l == r => 1 and l > r =>
# 0. For each pair l, r, we check base cases, then check the cache,
# otherwise compute the LPS, to do it, we check if the characters at l
# and r match, if they do, the result will be equal to the LPS at l+1,
# r-1 plus 2, if they don't match, the result will be the max LPS
# between not using the left or the right character.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We compute half of all possible values of
# (l, r) and the computations take amortized constant time.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - The dp array can hold one key for each
# combination of (l, r).
