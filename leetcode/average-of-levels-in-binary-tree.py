# This problem can be solved using breadth first search and computing the
# average of each level as we process them.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node of the tree once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The queue will hold at most one level at a
# time, one level can hold 2 times more nodes than the previous level
# and it can hold more than half of all the nodes in the tree > O(n/2).
#
# Runtime: 50 ms, faster than 96.56%
# Memory Usage: 16.5 MB, less than 87.46%
