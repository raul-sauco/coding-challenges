# Define a helper function to "say" the numbers iterating over the input
# digits and creating groups, then using the group length and content to
# generate the result.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*m) - n is the input and m is the average length of
# of the string generated. Since the input is fixed at 30, we could call
# it O(1) because the max length of both n and m is known.
# Space complexity: O(m) - m is the longest strings generated that needs
# to be stored in memory.
#
# Runtime: 115 ms, faster than 16.46%
# Memory Usage: 14.5 MB, less than 7.99%
