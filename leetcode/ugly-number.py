# possible, if the remainder is not 1, return false.

# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - At each step we divide the input by
# either 2, 3, or 5.
# Space complexity: O(1)

# Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 95.18%
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 60.08%

# Use math to solve the problem. If the input is a divisor of 30^32
# (2 * 3 * 5) ^ 32, then its only factors are the these numbers.
#
# Time complexity: O(1) - There is only one computation, so it should be
# considered O(1)? But the computation involves a fairly big number,
# locally it is slower than the O(log(n)) solution.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Even though it uses a pretty large integer.
