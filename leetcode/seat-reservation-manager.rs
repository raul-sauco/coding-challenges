/// We can use a heap with n elements, to optimize the memory efficiency, we can

/// to the next element that has not been reserved yet. If there are no elements
/// in the heap, we return the next unused seat number, if there are elements in
/// the heap, we know that they will be smaller than the next unreserved number,
/// and return the smallest element in the heap.
///
/// Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Worst case we end up with a heap of size n
/// and each push/pop costs log(n). When the heap is empty, reserve is O(1).
/// Space complexity: O(n) - Worst case scenario the heap fills up to size n.
