# A really interesting problem, combining elements of graphs with some math. The numbers in
# the input can be seen as nodes in a graph, the edges can be computed factorizing the
# numbers, any two values that share a common factor are connected, the graph is undirected,
# the problem asks us to determine if the graph is connected. The simplest way to compute the
# number of disjoint components in a graph is to use Union Find, if the graph has one
# component, it is connected, otherwise it isn't. We can initialize a union find structure,
# and a hashmap that keeps factors as keys and the index of a representative of that factor
# groups as the value, for each factor in a number, if we have seen that factor previously,
# we union the current index to that set, if we haven't we initialize a new set and use the
# current index as the representative. Since we know that the values are limited to 100000,
# we can optimize the computation of factors using an array of hardcoded primes, this array
# contains the 64 primes found between 2 and sqr(100000), any prime that is a factor of an
# input value we will obtain as the remainder of having removed all the prime factors up to,
# and including, 311. For example, the next prime 317, will need to be combined with a prime
# <= 311, because 317^2 = 100489.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Filtering duplicates is O(n), then iterating over the input is O(n)
# as well, because in the inner loop we iterate a fixed number of times, 64, calling the
# union operation in the union find structure is amortized O(1).
# Space complexity: O(n) - The union-find structure, and the representatives hashmap both can
# grow to size n. The representatives hashmap is more likely going to be closer to size 64,
# but that is not guaranteed, for example, every element in the input could be a prime > 311,
# each would result in an entry in the representatives set.
