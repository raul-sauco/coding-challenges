     * Use depth-first search starting from every node, keep visited nodes in
     * a set to make sure we only visit each node once. Keep also a hashmap
     * of sets that we have visited along the current path pointing to the
     * position along the path at which we saw them, if we see a node that we
     * already saw in the current path, we have found a cycle, the size of
     * the cycle is the difference between the two positions at which we
     * found the current node, if we get to a node that does not have any
     * outbound edges, we can return 0 because the path will not have any
     * cycles.
     *
     * Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once and do O(1) work,
     * once a node is visited along one path, we will not visit it from
     * another path, if a path leads to a node that was visited already, it
     * will stop there.
     * Space complexity: O(n) - The list of visited nodes and the dictionary
     * of nodes seen along the path can both be of size n.
     *
     * Runtime 76 ms Beats 28.57%
     * Memory 7.4 MB Beats 14.29%
