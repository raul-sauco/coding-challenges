     * components, it also keeps the value of the min value edge that has
     * been seen between the two components that are being connected and the
     * new edge that is being added, then return the minimum edge of the
     * set that contains node 1, since we are guaranteed that 1 and n are
     * connected, this set also contains n.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(e) - Where e is the number of edges, we iterate
     * over the edges and, for each, we do a union operation that runs in
     * amortized O(1) time.
     * Space complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of nodes, we have three
     * structures of size n.
