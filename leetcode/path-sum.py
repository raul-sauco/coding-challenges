# of the current root, if at some leaf we have the target sum, return
# True, otherwise return False when we run out of options. We can use
# the same hasPathSum, if either the left or right tree have the target
# sum of target-root.val, we can return True, otherwise False.

# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit every node once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack will grow in size
# proportionally to the size of the input.
