# The strings need to have the same unique characters, the same number
# of characters, length, and the same frequencies of groups of the same
# character. We don't need to check the input length, but speeds up by
# discarding in O(1) inputs where the strings have different lengths.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting the counter values has the
# highest complexity.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The counters could have the same size as the
# input strings.
#
# Runtime: 135 ms, faster than 99.60%
# Memory Usage: 15.4 MB, less than 16.80%

# Similar solution but, instead of sorting the character frequencies to
# compare them, we count them.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - All the operations happen in linear time.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The counters could have the same size as the
# input strings.
