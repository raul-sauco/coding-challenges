# If both input strings are formed by concatenating the same substring,
# then concatenating them should be an associative operation, we can
# use that to check if they have a GCD string. Once we know that they do,
# we know that the length of the GCD string will be the length of the
# GCD of their respective lengths.
#
# Time complexity: O(m+n) - We need to iterate both input strings to
# concatenate them and check if they have a GCD. The `gcd` function
# takes O(log(m*n)) time.
# Space complexity: O(m+n) - The concatenated strings use extra memory.
