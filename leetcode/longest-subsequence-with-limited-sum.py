# Create an array of prefix sums of the sorted input nums, result[i]
# will be the index at which we would need to insert that value on the
# prefix sum array to maintain the sorted order. What the algorithm does
# is to greedily pick the highest number of values that gives the lowest
# possible subsequence sum, then use binary search to determine how
# many values we can take while remaining below the given sum value.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n) + k*log(n)) - Where n is the number of
# elements in the nums array and k is the number of queries, we need to
# sort the array nums in n*log(n) time, and compute the prefix sums in
# O(n), then, for each query k, we use binary search in O(log(n)) time
# to find the minimum number of values we can sum while still remaining
# below the query value.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The prefix sum array has the same size as the
# nums array.
