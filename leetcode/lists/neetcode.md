# Neetcode categorized list of problems

One of the best resources to get started with algorithms and data structures problems is the [neetcode list][neetcode].

The list is an extension of the Blind 75 list with an extra 75 problems, for a total of 150, that results in a more beginner-friendly list and covers the topics more in depth.

From their website:

> The Blind 75 is a popular list of Algorithm practice problems. I created the Neetcode 150 by adding 75 more problems to make a more beginner friendly and more comprehensive list.
>
> Get stuck? I've created a thorough 🎥 video explanation for each problem.
