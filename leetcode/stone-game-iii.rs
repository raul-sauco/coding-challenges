    /// three possible results, that gives them the maximum score. Since the
    /// game is a zero sum game, we can keep track of the point difference
    /// between the two players after each play, and we can compute that
    /// difference for play starting at index i as the points obtained from
    /// picking 1..=3 stones minus the point difference given by the rest of
    /// the array knowing that the other player will also play optimally.

    /// each, in reverse, and do O(1) work for each since we are caching the
    /// results in the dp array.

    /// the stack instead of being forced to use the heap.
