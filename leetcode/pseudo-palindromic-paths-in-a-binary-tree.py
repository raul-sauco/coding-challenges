# Use DFS to find unique paths between the root and the leaves. While
# traveling down the path, keep track of node values that we have seen
# using a set, each time we see a match for a value, we know that we
# can use it to construct two symmetrical elements in the palindrome and
# we remove the match from the set. When we arrive at a leaf, we must
# have zero or one element left in the set for the path to be a pseudo
# palindrome.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once and perform O(1)
# operations.
# Space complexity: O(h) - Where h is the height of the tree, for the
# call stack. h could be equal to n if each node had a single child.
# The set uses O(1) because the values in the node can only be 1-9.
#
# Runtime: 1761 ms, faster than 20.88%
# Memory Usage: 85.1 MB, less than 71.65%
