# Play the smallest tokens to gain score and the bigger ones to gain
# power, that way we can maximize the number of plays.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Where n is the number of tokens. The
# sorting step has the highest cost, then we can play the tokens in O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n) - The queue has length n.
#
# Runtime: 90 ms, faster than 45.75%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 99.06%
