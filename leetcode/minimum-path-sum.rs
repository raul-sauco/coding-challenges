    /// Time complexity: O(m+n) - We visit each cell on the grid and do O(1)
    /// work for each.
    /// Space complexity: O(n) - The dp array has the same length as one row
    /// of the matrix, we could optimize this by checking if rows or columns are
    /// smaller and iterating over the shorter ones, if we had a strict memory
    /// limit.
