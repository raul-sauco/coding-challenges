# We can see that the number of ways to place n tokens will be the
# same as the number of ways to place n-1 tokens with one more before
# and after it plus the ways to combine these two blocks, which is
# equivalent to the ways to place n-3 tokens. That means that, to
# compute the number of ways to place n tokens, we need to start with
# the known ways to place n=1, n=2, n=3 and keep computing higher values
# using these until we arrive at n. Since we only need the previous 3
# values at any point, we only need to store these, we can use a
# sliding window of values, implemented using a queue.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We only do one operation and push/pop into a
# queue at any given time.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant space.
