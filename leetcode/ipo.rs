    /// start them. Have a main loop that iterates k times and does the following: First iterate
    /// over the sorted jobs vector starting at the index of the first job that we have not yet
    /// pushed into the heap, push into the heap any job for which we have enough capital,
    /// initially that will be w, but it increases with every job that we complete. Once we have
    /// all the jobs that we can embark on in the heap, we just pick the top job and increase our
    /// current capital by its net profit. If the heap is empty, it means that we cannot do any job
    /// and we can break out of the loop.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting the zipped profits and capital vector has the
    /// hihgest time complexity. After that we iterate k times and do O(log(h)) work on each, where
    /// h is the size of the heap and it could be equal to n. Even though we have an inner loop
    /// that iterates over the sorted vector, that iterates over a maximum of n elements overall in
    /// the k iterations.
    /// Space complexity: O(n) - Both the sorted vector and the heap can grow to size n.
