    // We want to greedily pick the job that gives us the maximum gain out of
    // the jobs that are available to us. We can use a heap to keep a list of
    // jobs sorted in reversed order by capital and a heap with the top
    // element being the one that gives us the maximum profit, after we
    // complete each job we update our current capital and iterate over the
    // jobs adding any available jobs to the heap, then pick the top job from
    // the heap in O(log(h)).
    //
    // Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting n jobs has a O(n*log(n))
    // complexity, then we iterate k times on which we pop elements from the
    // sorted list in O(1) and append them to the heap in O(log(h)) where h
    // is the current size of the heap and has an upper bound of n. Then we
    // pop from the heap in O(log(h)), it would seem that the complexity is
    // then O(k*n*log(n)) but, since any of the n jobs will be popped from the
    // list and added to the heap a maximum of 1 time, we know that the limit
    // of O(log(h)) insertions is n, since h is also bound to n, the time
    // complexity of both sections of the algorithm is the same, O(n*log(n)).
    // Space complexity: O(n) - Both the sorted list and the heap can grow to
    // a size of n.
