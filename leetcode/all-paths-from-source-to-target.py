# Use iterative depth-first search to travel all possible paths from
# 0 to n-1, when we get to n-1 we save the traveled path to the result
# list of paths.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*2^n) - Where n is the number of nodes in the
# input adjacency list. The decision tree splits in two at each level,
# O(2^n) but it also makes a copy of the list to add it to the paths at
# cost O(n) at each step.
# Space complexity: O(v*e) - The stack will hold a list of all possible
# paths in the graph.
