# Use a monotonic non-increasing stack to store temperatures seen for
# which we haven't found a higher temperature yet. Iterate over the
# input checking the current temperature against the ones stored in the
# stack, we pop all the lower temperatures and save the difference
# between indexes in the result array.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We process each temperature a max of 2 times.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The monotonic stack could grow to the same
# size as the input.
#
# This code failed with TLE but it seems to be a bug with the time
# limit in leetcode.
