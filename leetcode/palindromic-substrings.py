# The naive brute force solution checks every combination of indexes to
# see if the substring between them is a palindrome.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^3) - For each combination of 2 indexes O(n^2), we
# check if the substring between them is a palindrome O(n).
# Space complexity: O(n) - Reversing the string happens in memory.
#
# This solution would fail with Time Limit Exceeded.

# We can sacrifice memory to improve the results of the brute force
# solution, if we start building palindromes of length 1, 2, 3... and
# we store whether the string between two given indexes left-right is,
# or is not, a palindrome, then we can check in O(1) whether the
# substring i:j is a palindrome by checking if the string i+1:j-1 is a
# palindrome and s[i] == s[j].
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We still check each pair of characters, but
# this time we only do O(1) work for each.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - We save a value in the dp object for each
# pair of indexes in the input.
