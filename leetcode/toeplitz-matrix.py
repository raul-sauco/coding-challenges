# Find all the cells on the top row and leftmost column, use them as the
# start of all the matrixes diagonals and compare their value with all
# the values in the diagonal, if any of them is different, return false
# otherwise, once we have checked all diagonals, return true.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We visit each cell once and do O(1) work.
# Space complexity: O(m+n) - The start cells array will store all the
# cell indexes for the top row and first column.

# Runtime: 175 ms, faster than 60.11%
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 78.65%
