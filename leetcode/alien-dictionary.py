# Iterate over all characters in the input and add them to a set, then
# iterate over each pair of words until we find the one ordering
# relation that each can provide, use that relation to add two entries
# to an indegree and outdegree dictionaries. Also pop any characters
# that have dependencies from the set of all characters. On the second
# half of the algorithm, we heapify the set of all characters and use
# it as the queue for our BFS, we pop characters from it and iterate
# over their dependencies removing the current character. Any
# dependent that sees all its dependencies removed is added to the heap.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - Where m is the number of words and n is
# the average length of the words. We iterate over all words at O(m) and
# check the characters at the same index O(n).
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - We store the input in several structures.

# Runtime: 122 ms, faster than 16.80% on LintCode.
# Memory Usage: 6.88 MB, less than 16.80%

# The DFS solution by NeetCode is much more efficient on the tests even

# Use the clues in the input to build a graph of chars -> set(higher
# lexicographical order chars), then do DFS from each root char key
# creating a list of the lexicographically ordered characters (in alien
# order first then latin order). Use a visit dictionary for a double
# purpose, mark characters as false once we have processed them and as
# true when they are part of the current path that we are exploring on
# the depth-first search. If we ever try to process a character that
# is marked as true, we have found a cycle and we can return "".
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - Where m*n is the number of characters in the
# input. This comes from the first part of the algorithm where we build
# the adjacency list, the second part of the algorithm, the depth-first
# search, runs on O(1) because it will be called a max of 26 times, when
# we call it for a character that we have processed already, it will
# immediately return the stored result.
# Space complexity: O(1) - The call stack could be as deep as the number
# of keys in adj, that number also is the number of unique characters in
# the input and it maxes at 26. O(26) => O(1).
