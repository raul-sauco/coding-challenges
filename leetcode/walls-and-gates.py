# Use a variable for this the value that represents infinity in this
# problems.
INF = 2147483647


# Using breadth first search, we first queue all gates, then iterate over
# the queue adding infinity nodes to it, then BFS using the queue, for
# each position in the queue, check which of its neighbors is accessible
# update its value with the distance traveled from the gate and add it
# to the queue to process its neighbors on the next iteration.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node a max of 2 times.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The queue could grow to the same size as the
# matrix.
