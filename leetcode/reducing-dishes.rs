    /// by taking all positive values sorted and multiplied by their indexes + 1
    /// Then, every time we add a negative value, it is better to pick the
    /// greater one (closer to zero) and try it on the furthest left index, 0.
    /// The result of adding that value will be adding the negative value * 1 to
    /// the result, and shifting all the previous values to the right one
    /// position, which we can compute as being equal to the current sum of
    /// values in the vector. If the result of adding this value is a gain, do
    /// it, otherwise, stop trying to add values and return the result.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting the positive and negative values
    /// vectors has the highest complexity, everything else is O(n) we iterate
    /// over the values to split them into positive and negative, iterate over
    /// the positive values to create the initial sum and result and then
    /// iterate over the negative values checking if it is worth adding them in
