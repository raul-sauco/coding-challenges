import timeit


# Keep a hashmap, or a vector of indexes indexed by character, of the
# last position at which we have seen a given character, also
# save the start index of the current partition that we are building,
# then iterate over the characters in the input, if we see a character
# that is contained in the current partition, we need to start a new
# one.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate over the characters in the input
# string and do constant time work for each.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant extra space, pointers and a
# vector of size 26.
