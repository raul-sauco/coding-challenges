# We need to explore the entire tree using any type of DFS, we cannot
# use BFS because we want to visit leaves, possibly on different levels,
# on a right-to-left or left-to-right order. We explore the tree and,
# when we find a leave, we add it to the result set. We only need to
# guarantee that the order in which we visit the leaves is the same on
# the first and second tree.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We will visit all nodes.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack or call stack will grow to the
# height of the tree, if skewed, it could be the same as its size.

# Space complexity: O(n) - In the worst case the height of the tree will
# be the same as its size.
