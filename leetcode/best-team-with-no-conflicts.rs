    // Once we sort the players by score, this problem becomes obtaining the
    // sum of scores of players up to, and including, a given age that we
    // have seen already. That makes this problem similar to range sum
    // query mutable in that we need to efficiently update elements in an
    // array and query sum ranges at that point, before we add any player
    // with a higher score.
    //
    // Time complexity: O(n*log(a)) - Where n is the number of players and a
    // is the max age in the input and it is limited to a max a 1000.
    // Space complexity: O(n) - The sorted players array has the same size as
    // the input, the binary indexed tree has size max(ages).
    //
    // Runtime 5 ms Beats 100%
    // Memory 2.2 MB Beats 100%
