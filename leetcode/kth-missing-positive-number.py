# Looking for a solution to use bisect, I came to this:
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/39501468/2557030
# It uses the same logic as the previous solution but uses bisect to
# find the "insertion point" instead of manually doing it, I expected
# this solution to run faster but it didn't and it used more more
# memory, which makes sense because it uses an extra nested class.
