    // source, also, once we get to the destination, we have a ceiling in
    // how much an itinerary can cost before we decide that it is not worth
    // pursuing it any longer. All that means that we can use BFS to explore
    // one level at a time, we start by flying from the source to all
    // available destinations, then, from all of them to all the ones that
    // we can reach from there and so on, if the price to get to a destination
    // is greater than a price that we have seen before, with least stops, we
    // discard that branch, if the price of a trip becomes greater than the
    // cheapest way to get to dst found so far, we discard it as well, we
    // run the BFS algorithm k+1 times, then return the solution or -1.
    //
    // Time complexity: O(n*k) - The outer loop runs k times, the inner loop
    // will average n items maximum because we only enqueue elements when we
    // find a cheaper path in a later iteration.
    // Space complexity: O(f) - Where f is the number of flights, we save all
    // flight information in the adjacency list.
