# Simulate the movements that are allowed but in reverse, starting at
# the target point and trying to reach (1, 1).
#
# Time complexity: O(log(max(m, n))) - At each step we divide by 2
# approximately, if one of the values is not divisible one loop, it will
# became divisible in the next loop.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only store two integers and one tuple with
# two elements.

# Great solutions using the greater common divisor in the discuss
