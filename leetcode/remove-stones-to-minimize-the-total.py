# Use a heap, ideally a maximum heap, but in Python we can use a minimum
# heap with negated values to remove half of the stones from the largest
# pile at each step.
#
# Time complexity: O(k*log(n)) - We copy and heapify the input array at
# O(n), then iterate over it k times pushing and popping from the heap
# at O(log(n)) cost.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The values heap has the same size as the
# input. If we can mutate the input, we could use that array and reduce
# the complexity to O(1) extra memory.
