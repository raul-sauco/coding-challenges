    // We can use a postorder DFS, each node returns the number of people
    // traveling and the amount of gas consumed to get everyone there, the
    // parent looks at the number of people and computes the cost of getting
    // everyone from the child to itself, then adds up all the costs plus
    // the representative starting the journey there and returns that
    // information to the parent.
    //
    // Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node twice, once in the
    // traversal and once when computing the results using the children's
    // returns.
    // Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack could grow to size n with a
    // skewed tree.
    //
    // Runtime 68 ms Beats 100%
