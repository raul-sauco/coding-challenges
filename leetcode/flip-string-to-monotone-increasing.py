# Do one pass forward counting the number of updates we would need to
# do if the switch point between 0s and 1s was at the last index, i.e.
# if we converted the entire string to 0s. Then start iterating back,
# checking how many updates we would need to have the inflection point
# at the current index, if we see a 1, we can subtract one from the
# current count of updates, we would not have needed to update that
# position to be a 1, if we see a 0, we would have needed one more
# update for that position to be a 1.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We traverse the string twice, once forward and
# once in reverse.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use two integers and an iterator of extra
# memory.
