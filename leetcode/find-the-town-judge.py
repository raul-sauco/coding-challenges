# We can solve this problem using topological sorting, create sets of
# elements that are trusted by the current one and elements that the
# current one trusts, return the element that does not trust any others
# and is trusted by n-1 others.
#
# Time complexity: O(n+t) - Where n is n and t is the number of items
# in the trust array. We iterate over all the elements in trust to
# create the topological sorting, then iterate over a max of n elements
# to find the one that matches the given conditions.
