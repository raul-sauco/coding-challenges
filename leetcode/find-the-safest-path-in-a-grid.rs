    /// closets thieve, we can do that in O(n^2) using BFS with each cell with a thieve on it as
    /// the start, once we visit all the cells, we have computed the distance between the thieves
    /// and all cells. Then we use that distance matrix and a Dijkstra traverse that priorizes
    /// based on safety instead of distance, we start by pushing the start cell into the heap, when
    /// we pop a cell, we check if the safety value of that path has decreased to 0, in that case,
    /// we can already return 0 because the safety of paths cannot improve, only decrease, and that
    /// top path is the "safest" in the heap. If the cell we popped is the bottom-right cell, we
    /// return the safety of the path we took to get there, including the safety of the
    /// bottom-right cell. Otherwise we visit its 4-directional neighbors and push any of them
    /// within bounds that we have not visited previously.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n^2*log(n)) - We push/pop elements from the heap of size n^2, at most we
    /// will push/pop each of the n^2 elements once because we are marking them as visited.
    /// Space complexity: O(n^2) - The grid copy with safety values, the double ended queue and the
    /// binary heap.
