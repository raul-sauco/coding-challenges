# column and number of removals before we find a solution or decide that
# there isn't one.

# grow linearly in size with the size of the input.

# we cannot greedily keep the shortest travel time to a cell without
# taking into account the number of obstacles that we have removed. I am
# keeping this solution here because it was the first one I came up with
# and it passes the tests.
