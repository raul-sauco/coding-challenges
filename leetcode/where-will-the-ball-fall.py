# Simulate the balls falling through the grid keeping an array
# positions, of size n that records where the i-th ball is on the
# m-th move. If a ball gets stuck, update its position to -1 and ignore
# it on further moves.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We calculate each value of position (n) for
# each move of the balls (m).
# Space complexity: O(1) - If we don't take input and output into
# consideration, the positions array is O(n) but we are using it as the
# output.
#
# Runtime: 207 ms, faster than 91.65%
# Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 84.52%
