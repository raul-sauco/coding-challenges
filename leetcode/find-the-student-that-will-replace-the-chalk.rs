    /// small optimizations, like use a prefix sum and then use binary search to find the index of
    /// the student in the last loop, but since we need to compute the sum of the input vector, we
    /// still need to visit each element.

    /// Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element to compute the total sum and to find the
    /// index of the student that replaces the chalk.
    /// Space complexity: O(1) - We store the total sum and the remainder.
