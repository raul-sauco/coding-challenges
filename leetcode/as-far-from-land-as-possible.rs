impl Solution {
    // Use BFS and a matrix with the current shortest distance between any
    // cell and land to compute the shortest distance between any cell and
    // land, we will only revisit cells when the new distance to land is
    // less than the shortest previous distance found, which may, in turn,
    // influence its neighbors by providing a shorter path to land.
    //
    // Time complexity: O(m+n) - We can travel a maximum of n levels, on each
    // level, we will only visit cells to which we have not previously found
    // a shorter route, in total we will visit m*n cells during the BFS.
    // Space complexity: O(m+n) - The distance matrix has the same size as
    // the input matrix, m rows and n columns.
    //
    // Runtime 12 ms Beats 66.67%
    // Memory 2.3 MB Beats 93.33%
