import timeit
from typing import List


# Sort the intervals by start ascending and end descending order.
# Iterate over the sorted intervals keeping the last "used" interval
# stored in a variable, for each interval, we check if it overlaps the
# last interval we kept, if it does, we remove the one out of the two
# that ends later, to minimize collisions with later intervals.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - For the sorting. Then O(n) to check
# for overlapping intervals.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Sorting in python takes up to O(n/2) memory.
#
# Runtime: 2265 ms, faster than 72.50%
# Memory Usage: 52.7 MB, less than 59.13%
