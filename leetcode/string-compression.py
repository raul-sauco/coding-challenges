import timeit
from typing import List


# Use two pointers, one to read and one to write, iterate over all the
# characters in the input reading characters while there are any and
# they are the same as the current sequence's character, when we run out
# of characters or find a new character, we write down the compressed
# sequence and check if there are more characters to read.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each character in the input once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use pointers and create a new string of
# the digits of count that can be at most of length 4.

# Runtime 64 ms Beats 51.18%
