# Naively we can perform breath first search using begin word as the
# start and traveling one level at a time until we find the end word or
# arrive at a level with no words. A level consists on all words that
# we have not visited before and are 1 character away from any word in
# the previous level.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - Where n is the number of words in the word
# dictionary, we need to check each word against all others to find
# its neighbors.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The available set starts at size n.
#
# This solution fails with Time Limit Exceeded.

# Preprocess the words to obtain a dictionary of word variations, in

# the words trying to find the ones that are one character away from the
# current one, use its possible variations to obtain its neighbors in
# O(1), max 10 variations O(1) access to the list of words that could
# produce these variations.

# Time complexity: O(n) - We could still visit all the words in the
# dictionary, but this time we only do O(1) work for each.
