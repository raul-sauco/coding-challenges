# Iterate over all the list nodes, for each, create a temporary pointer
# to it, then make the right node point to the left one and the left to
# the next one.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant memory.
#
# Runtime: 39 ms, faster than 92.11%
# Memory Usage: 15.4 MB, less than 55.68%

# Recursively call the function with each node and its previous one.

# node in the input list.
