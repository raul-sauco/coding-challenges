# Sort the input array, then we can iterate over the numbers, starting
# at the lowest, and binary search the highest value that we can use in
# combination with the lower l. The number of valid combinations is the
# number of subsequences that we can build with sn[l] as the min and
# none or any of the other values between l and r as the maximum.
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n) * n) - We sort the input elements, which
# already takes O(log(n)*n), then we also try all elements as the lower
# boundary l and, for each, binary search in log(n) the maximum r that
# we can use.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The sorted array takes extra n memory.
