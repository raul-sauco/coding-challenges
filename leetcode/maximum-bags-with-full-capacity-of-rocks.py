# This is a template that can be used as the starting point of a
# solution with minimal changes.


# We need to compute each bag's remaining space and then start adding
# rocks to the bags that have the least amount of remaining space,
# because we are trying to maximize the number of bags that we fill.
# One way to do that is to compute the remaining space and use a heap to
# store it, then start popping from the heap and subtracting the
# amount of rocks that we need to use to fill each bag from the amount
# of bags that we have remaining. Stop once we don't have enough rocks
# to fill the next bag or we have filled all the bags.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We pop n elements from the heap at
# a log(n) cost.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The remaining capacity array.
