# We iterate over all pairs of numbers in the input computing their
# difference, for each array element, we have a dictionary of
# sequences that end at the given element keyed by the sequence
# arithmetic difference. If the difference between the current elements
# is in the dictionary of the left element, it means that there are that
# many sequences with that difference that end up at that number, and
# we can extend them by adding the element under the right pointer.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We visit each pair of elements in the input.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - For each element in the input, we store a
# maximum of n entries in the dictionary at its position in dp.
