# Find the parent of each node then travel upwards from any node that
# is an apple until we either get to the root or to a node that we have
# visited already, each edge we travel adds 2 to the result because we
# will need to travel it in two directions when we travel from the root
# to collect all apples.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node several times, to form the
# adjacency list, the parents array and finding the paths to collect
# the apples.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The neighbors set will have as many entries
# as edges in the tree, in a tree, the number of edges is n-1. The
# parents array is size n.
