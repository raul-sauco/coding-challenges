import timeit
from typing import List


# Use BFS and a matrix with the current shortest distance between any
# cell and land to compute the shortest distance between any cell and
# land, we will only revisit cells when the new distance to land is
# less than the shortest previous distance found, which may, in turn,
# influence its neighbors by providing a shorter path to land.
#
# Time complexity: O(m+n) - We can travel a maximum of n levels, on each
# level, we will only visit cells to which we have not previously found
# a shorter route, in total we will visit m*n cells during the BFS.
# Space complexity: O(m+n) - The distance matrix has the same size as
# the input matrix, m rows and n columns.
#
# Runtime 548 ms Beats 82.97%
# Memory 14.6 MB Beats 64.75%
