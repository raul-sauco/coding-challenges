    /// We can use a monotonic queue to be able to access the max value in the
    /// sliding window in linear time. The monotonic queue will store a maximum
    /// of k elements and it guarantees that the order of the elements is
    /// strictly increasing from left to right.
    ///
    /// Since we are managing the monotonic queue manually, i.e. it is not a
    /// built-in structure like the heap of the previous solution, we can
    /// store element indexes in the queue and access the element in nums to
    /// check its value. This has the advantage that we check both value and
    /// position storing only one value.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n) - We only visit each element once, and push/pop
    /// it from the queue a maximum of 1 time.
    /// Space complexity: O(n) - The queue is of max size k, but the result
    /// array size depends on the input size as well.
