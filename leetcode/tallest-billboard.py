import timeit

from typing import List


# Keep a hashmap where the keys are the difference between the shortest
# and longest legs of the billboard and the value is the maximum height
# that we have been able to reach with that difference between the two
# legs. For each element in the input, we compute the result of the
# three options that can be taken, adding it to the shorter leg, the
# longer one, and not using it.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*m) - We iterate over all the n rods, for each, we
# iterate over all the possible keys in the dp hash map, that can take
# any value between 0 and the maximum gap m that we can have between the
# length of both legs.
# Space complexity: O(m) - The number of keys that we can have in the dp
# hashmap, it is the number of values that the gap can take and it could
# be equal to the sum of values in the rods vector, if all gap values
# were possible.

# Neat solution by Lee@215, it merges both ideas in the editorial
# splitting the problem in two to reduce the exponential complexity
# while using the concepts of the dynamic programming solution.

# Time complexity: O(n*m) - Where n = len(rods) <= 20, s = sum(rods) <=
# 5000 and m = possible sums == possible keys = min(3^n/2, s)
# Space complexity: O(m) - The number of keys.
