import timeit


# Decompose the input into its constituent digits, then reverse them and
# construct a value that has all digits at their corresponding place, to
# do that, we can use the fact that we are using base 10 and multiply
# each number by 10^i where i is its order in the resulting digit.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - With n the number of digits in the input or
# O(log(n)) with n the value of the input, at each iteration of the
# loop we divide this value by 10.
# Space complexity: O(n) - With n the number of digits in the input, we
# store a list of the input's value digits.
#
# Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 16.21%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 64.41%
