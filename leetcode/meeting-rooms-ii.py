# Definition of Interval:
class Interval:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Interval({self.start},{self.end})"


# Iterate over the intervals placing all intervals that we can into one
# meeting room and the ones that we can't into an array of non
# compatible meetings. Recursively call minMeetingRooms with that array
# and return the result of the recursive call plus 1 for the current
# meeting room.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - If all meetings are incompatible, we will
# check each pair of meetings for compatibility.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The data structures and the call stack all
# can reach size n where n is the number of intervals.
#
# Runtime: 82 ms, faster than 61.60% on LintCode.
# Memory Usage: 6.07 MB, less than 61.60%
class Recursive:

            return 0
        intervals.sort(key=lambda interval: interval.start)

# Similar idea to the previous solution. We place intervals into rooms
# as long as there is no overlap, when we find overlap we create a new
# room. For each interval, we iterate over the rooms until we find one
# that does not contain overlapping intervals, if none is found, we
# create a new room for the interval.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - For each interval, we may iterate over all
# the rooms which can have the same length as the intervals.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The rooms array will have i rooms and an
# average of j meetings per room where i * j == number of intervals.
#
# Runtime: 101 ms, faster than 56.40% on LintCode.
# Memory Usage: 9.08 MB, less than 56.40%

# We can use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. Sort start and
# end times into their own arrays, use two pointers to visit the next
# "event" on the timeline, be it a start or end, by choosing the
# smaller element under either of the pointers, when we choose a start,
# we increase the count of meetings that are simultaneously taking
# place at that moment by one, when we choose and end, we decrease the
# same count also by one. The result is the highest count of
# simultaneous meetings that we see.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each interval twice at most, one when
# we see its start value, and maybe one more when we see its end value.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The start and end array both have n items.

# Runtime: 102 ms, faster than 36.80% on LintCode.
# Memory Usage: 6.05 MB, less than 36.80%
