impl Solution {
    // Visit each element of the array but do it in groups, we can see it as
    // treating each group as a level and the algorithm as BFS. For each
    // level, keep track of the farthest position we could jump to from this
    // level. When we get to the end of the level, add one to the number of
    // jumps that we have taken, and update the current level by updating the
    // last element we can explore to match the farthest element we can
    // reach from this level.
    // The algorithm repeatedly calculates the farthest point we can reach
    // from any of the positions that we can reach given the current number
    // of jumps, then "jump" once more and continue calculating. Each element
    // is only explored once.
    //
    // Time complexity: O(n) - Each element is visited once.
    // Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.
