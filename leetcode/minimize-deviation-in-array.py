# The problem lets us do two operations on the input array elements,
# for even numbers, it lets us divide them by 2 as long as they remain
# even, for odd numbers, we can multiply them by 2 once, then they
# become even. To simplify the problem, we can start by multiplying all
# odd values by 2, that way each element is at the maximum it can be,
# and them pushing them all into a max heap after checking the value
# of the smallest item in the heap. While we can make the biggest
# current element smaller, that is while the top of the heap is even,
# and we can divide it by 2, we will pop that element and compute the
# current difference between it and the smallest element currently in
# the heap, if the gap is the smallest seen so far, we will record it as
# the temporary result, then we divide the value by 2 and push it back
# into the heap. When we find an odd element as the top of the heap, we
# know that we cannot make it any smaller and so we can stop iterating.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We may pop and push all elements in the
# input array a certain number of times t, t has a logarithmic relation
# to the value of the element and its upper bound is 30 because of
# log2(10^9), therefore time complexity is n*30*log(n) and we can
# simplify it.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The heap will have the same size as nums.
#
# Runtime 1383 ms Beats 82.61%
# Memory 21.3 MB Beats 97.10%
