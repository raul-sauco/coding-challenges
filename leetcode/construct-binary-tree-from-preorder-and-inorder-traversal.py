# We can use the preorder array to find the root of the current tree.
# We can use that value to split the inorder array:
# - values left of the root belong to the left subtree
# - values right of the root belong to the right subtree
# Keep doing it recursively for the right and left trees
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - The number of calls is the same as the
# number of elements in the input, but for each call, we slice the input
# array into two at a O(n) cost.
# Space complexity: O(n*log(n)) - If the tree is well balanced its height
# will be log(n), each call has its own copy of the input arrays at O(n),
# if the tree is not well balanced, then up to O(n) calls for a space
# complexity of O(n^2).

# Optimize the previous solution using a hashmap to find the index of
# an element in the inorder array and by passing indexes, instead of
# slicing the arrays, to recursive calls.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Now each recursive call does O(1) work and
# there are n calls, where n is the number of elements in the input.
# Space complexity: O(1) - The hashmap has as many elements as there
# are in the input, the call stack will have log(n) to n calls,
# depending on how well balanced the tree is.
