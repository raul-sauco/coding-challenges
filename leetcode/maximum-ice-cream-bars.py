# Sort the costs and iterate over them buying as many ice creams,
# greedily choosing the cheapest first, until we either bought all of
# the ice cream or run out of coins.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting the costs has the highest
# complexity.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Sorting in Python takes linear space.

# Use bucket sort to improve the time complexity, we first place all the
# ice cream in an array of frequencies indexed by their price, then
# iterate over that array to compute how many ice creams we can buy.

# Time complexity: O(n+p) - We iterate over p positions, where p is the
# highest value in the costs array, then we iterate, to save the
# frequencies into the buckets array we iterate over the n elements on
# the input array costs.
# Space complexity: O(p) - The buckets array has a size p where p is the
# highest cost in the input.
