# The brute force solution simply visits each of the stops and, from
# each of them, starts traveling to the next one until it either gets
# back to the start position or fails to reach the next position.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We visit each position and, for each, travel
# forward, possibly the entire input.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.
#
# This solution would fail with Time Limit Exceeded.

# There is a key observation that can help us go from O(n^2) to O(n)
# time complexity, it has two components:
# We calculate the sums of the gas and cost arrays, if the sum of gas is
# less than the sum of costs, we will not be able to go all the way
# around, and we can return -1, otherwise we know that there is a
# solution. We start visiting the first element (it could be any
# element, but visiting i=0 first simplifies the code) and checking if
# we can travel to the next element, then keep doing this while we can
# reach the next element. If at some point we cannot reach the next
# element, we know that we have a gas deficiency in the section that we
# have visited already, that means that, if we take the remaining
# elements, there will be a gas surplus so, by starting at the first
# element after an element that has a negative gas - cost balance, we
# can be sure that we will be able to travel all the way around.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space.

# Runtime: 824 ms, faster than 74.70%
# Memory Usage: 19.1 MB, less than 77.68%
