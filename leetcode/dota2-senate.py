# Use two queues, one for each group of senators, store their index in
# the queues, for each vote, check who is the next senator that has the
# right to vote, that senator will greedily ban the first senator in the
# other group that can vote, then will move themselves to the end of its
# group's queue.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - The maximum number of times the senators can
# vote, which is the same as the number of times the while loop will
# run, is equal to the number of senators, each round half the senators
# get to vote and remove half of the remaining ones.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The size of the queues.
