import timeit

# Similar to unique paths, since we can only move right or down, the
# number of ways to reach any cell equals the sum of the number of ways
# to reach the cell above it and the number of ways to reach the cell to
# its left. When we find an obstacle, the number of ways to reach that
# cell is 0 since we cannot visit it.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We will visit each cell once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We use an array of size n to store
# intermediate results.
#
# Runtime 45 ms Beats 86.33%
# Memory 13.8 MB Beats 97.57%
