# We can use a recursive call that computes the height of the left and
# right child and returns the maximum between them plus one for the
# current level.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We will visit each node in the tree.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The height of the call stack, it could go
# from O(n) in the worst case, a skewed tree, to O(log(n)) best case if
# the tree was well balanced.
#
# Runtime: 41 ms, faster than 93.90%
# Memory Usage: 16.2 MB, less than 74.04%

# a level could have more than half the nodes in the tree.
