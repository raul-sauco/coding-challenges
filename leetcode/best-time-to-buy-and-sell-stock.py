# The max profit will come from buying at the lowest price possible and
# selling at the highest possible price after that lowest price. We can
# keep a variable with the lowest price that we have seen so far, for
# each element, first we check if its value is less than the current
# lowest price, if it is, we update lowest price and move to the next
# element, if it isn't, we check if the profit of buying at the current
# lowest price and selling at this price is better than the current
# maximum profit, if it is, we update it. Once we iterate over all
# prices, we return the maximum profit found.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each price once and do O(1) work.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant extra memory.

# Similar to the previous solution but starts at the end of the array
# and works backwards keeping the value of the highest future price
# seen and using that to compute the max profit.
