# Use a trie to do quick lookups of the words, since the words are max
# 10 characters long, looking up a word in the trie can be done in O(1).
# Iterate over all the positions in the matrix doing DFS starting at
# that position and moving to its neighbors while the words that we are
# constructing are prefixes found in the trie. When we find a word, add
# it to the result set. Using the trie to do prefix and word lookups
# should be all that is expected in an interview but adding the word
# removal is an optimization that could be discussed.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n*(4*3^10)) - We iterate over all the positions
# on the board, for each, we start a search for any words that can be
# constructed from this position, the search will initially move to the
# four neighbors, then from there, as long as the characters added are
# found in the trie, the search will expand to the three neighbors of
# the new cell, since the cell we just came from cannot be visited again.
# So, from each position in the matrix, we will potentially do 4*3^10
# calls to DFS, since the max depth is equal to the length of the
# longest word in the trie and that is a max of 10. In theory that is
# still O(1) but it seems significant enough that is worth mentioning it
# on the time complexity.
# Space complexity: O(w*c) - The number of characters in all the words
# in the input, we store them all in the trie, and potentially also in
# the result set even though we would not consider that because it is
# used as the output. The call stack will have a max height of 10.
#
# On LeetCode, the obvious trie and DFS solution needs to be optimized
# to pass the tests and not give TLE, removing the words from the trie
# after finding them in the board is enough as of november 2022.

# There are a couple of optimizations that we can do once we see the
# particular tests that LeetCode is using. The tests lead to high
# recursion by having boards with high frequencies of one character and
# words with multiple instances of that character at the beginning, for
# example a board with almost all "a" and a high number of words like
# "aaaaaaaaab". Once we know that, we can improve the solution to
# perform better in the tests with a couple of optimizations. The first
# is by creating a lookup set of all the two character combinations
# found in the board and discarding any words that have a two character
# sequence not in the lookup.
# The second is by reversing all words in which we detect a high
# frequency of one character at the beginning. I think that this
# optimizations are very specific for this particular tests and not
# general enough to be very useful in a real world or interview set up,
# but it was an interesting case of optimization.
#
# Time and space complexity are the same as the previous solution even
# though the runtime is hundreds of times faster.
