# Cast all the input lists to sets removing any that have duplicate
# characters, since we will never be able to use them. Recursively
# explore the results of choosing to use, or not use, each of the
# resulting sets and return the length of the resulting group of
# characters keeping the best of them.
#
# Time complexity: O(1) - The recursive cost in O(2^n) where n is the
# length of the input array, but the problem guarantees that the input
# will be at most 16 sequences long. O(2^16) == O(1).
# Space complexity: O(1) - The call stack will have at most 16 calls,
# the set of used characters that we are passing will have, at most,
# 26 characters, the list of sets that we cast the input to will have
# at max 26*16 characters.
#
# Runtime: 86 ms, faster than 97.80%
# Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 43.86%
