# We want to make sure that we are doing something else while the plants
# are growing, we can start planting the ones that will take the longest
# time to bloom once planted, then, while we "wait" for them, we can
# get busy and keep planting the next ones.

# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - For the sorting.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Sorting takes O(n) in the worst case.
