# Solution using string.join and filter to clean up the non
# alphanumerical characters, then two pointers with a while loop to
# check if the remaining characters are a palindrome.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - One pass to clean up the input and another to
# check if the remaining characters form a palindrome.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Only pointers stored in memory though maybe
# join and filter may use extra memory.
#
# Runtime: 43 ms, faster than 95.95%
# Memory Usage: 14.7 MB, less than 43.02%
