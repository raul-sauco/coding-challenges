    /// Count the character frequencies in the input string, then iterate over
    /// them while keeping a hashset of frequencies that we have seen. For each
    /// character, while its frequency is greater than 0 and the current frequency
    /// has been used, it is in the frequency set, delete one occurrence. Once
    /// we find a free frequency count, store it in the set to avoid having
    /// another character use it.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate once over the input string, then we
    /// iterate over the frequencies, even though there are nested loops, the
    /// inner loop can only iterate over a maximum of 26 values because we only
    /// have 26 possible frequencies, one for each lowercase character.
    /// Space complexity: O(1) - The frequency array and the hash set both have
    /// a maximum size of 26 elements.
