    /// From each position, the player whose turn is can choose anywhere
    /// between 1 and 2*number of stones taken in the last move, the maximum
    /// score comes from choosing the max score possible between any of these
    /// choices taking into account that the other player will also play
    /// optimally, which means the score obtained by taking that many stones
    /// minus the score obtained by the other player from playing optimally the
    /// remaining of the array. We can recursively compute this result caching
    /// intermediate results to avoid recalculating results for the same play,
    /// which would result in exponential time complexity.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n^3) - We may call the dfs function for every
    /// possible combination of start and end values, for each call, we will
    /// iterate between 1 and the next "end", to represent that the player can
    /// choose to take anywhere between 1 and the current maximum of stones
    /// they are allowed to take.
    /// Space complexity: O(n^2) - The size of the cache, which is n*n. The
    /// call stack can grow to a depth of n.
    ///
    /// Runtime 6 ms Beats 66.25%
    /// Memory 2.2 MB Beats 83.75%
