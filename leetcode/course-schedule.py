# Use Kahn's algorithm of topological sorting to obtain two dictionaries
# one with the course as the key and the indegree as the value, another
# also with the courses as key but with a list of other courses that
# depend on them, outdegree vertexes, as the value.
#
# Creating the dictionaries takes O(n) to iterate over the courses and
# O(1) to append entries to the dictionaries.
#
# Once we have that list, we create a queue containing all the courses
# that do not have any dependencies, the ones that don't have an entry
# in the indegree dictionary.
#
# On this step we also iterate over the input to check if the course is
# in the dictionary indegree. O(n)
#
# Then we start popping courses from the queue, for each course, we
# visit each of its dependents on the dependencies dictionary values,
# for each, we register that we have cleared one dependency, by
# subtracting one from its indegree. If the indegree has reached 0, we
# have cleared all dependencies, remove that course from the indegree
# dictionary and add it to the queue to be processed later.
#
# When we run out of courses to process in the queue, we are done. If
# there are any entries left in the indegree dictionary, it means that
# there is at least one course that we could not take, because we didn't
# manage to clear its dependencies, return False, otherwise, we took all
# the courses and we can return True.
#
# Time complexity: O(n+p) - The complexity comes from looping through
# all dependencies of the elements we pop from the queue. We have n
# nodes and a total of p elements in the dependencies list, where p is
# the number of edges in the graph.
# Space complexity: O(n+p) - The indegree dictionary and the queue have
# a max of O(n) size but, the dependencies dictionary will have a total
# of p elements between all the dependencies lists.

# Runtime: 110 ms, faster than 86.14%
# Memory Usage: 15.7 MB, less than 70.84%
