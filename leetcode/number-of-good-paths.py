# The brute force solution searches all paths, starting at every node
# and visiting all other nodes until the path is not good while counting
# good paths and adding them to the total result.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - Starting at each node, we do a depth-first
# search that could potentially visit all other nodes.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The neigbors array has one entry per edge in
# the graph, and there are n-1 edges.
#
# This solution fails with time limit exceeded.

# A better solution uses the union find algorithm, we process the nodes
# in increasing order of value by using their neighbors information to
# add any nodes with equal or inferior values into a series of disjoint
# sets. Once we have created the disjoint groups that contain all nodes
# with a given value, we count the number of nodes in each group, since
# we know that the groups only contain nodes with equal or less value,
# we know that there is a path between any two nodes in that group.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - The highest complexity comes from
# sorting the keys of the value to node dictionary, since all nodes
# could have unique values, that operation costs O(n*log(n)).
# Space complexity: O(n) - The parents, rank and value to node all have
# a linear relation with the number of nodes in the input.

# keeps the number of nodes with each value in each disjoint set and
