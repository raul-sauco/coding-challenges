# Use union find to check if the graph is connected and also check if
# the number of edges equals the number of vertex minus one to determine
# if there are any cycles.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of edges/nodes. If this
# number is not equal + 1, then the first conditional fails and it
# returns in O(1), if the values are similar, we iterate over the edges
# then over the nodes.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Both the rank and parents array grow to the
# size of the input.
#
# Runtime: 102 ms, faster than 69.0%
# Memory Usage: 6.53 MB, less than 98.53%

# count of nodes, if it isn't, the graph is not connected and we can
# return false.

# same node a second time we immediately return false.
# Space complexity; O(n) - The adjecency list dictionary and the set
# will grow at max to size n.
