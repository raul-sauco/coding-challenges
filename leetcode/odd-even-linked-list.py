# Maintain two heads, odd and even lists, and iterate over the original
# linked list alternatively linking elements to one, then the other list
# until we are out of either odd or even elements. Link the two lists
# and return them.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each element once.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only keep pointers in memory.
#
# Runtime: 50 ms, faster than 85.69%
# Memory Usage: 16.6 MB, less than 78.70%
