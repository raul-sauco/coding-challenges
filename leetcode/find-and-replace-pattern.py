# We need to visit each character of each string to check if they match
# the pattern, it seems like the best we can do is O(n) where n is the
# number of characters in the input.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - With n the combined number of characters in
# the input strings, we may end up visiting each character in each one.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The result set could grow to the same size
# as the input.

# Runtime: 59 ms, faster than 32.35% of Python3 online submissions for
# Find and Replace Pattern.
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 28.72% of Python3 online submissions
# for Find and Replace Pattern.

# We can improve on the solution above using some built-in functions to
# execute the same logic.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - With n the combined number of characters in
# the input strings, we may end up visiting each character in each one.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The memory usage could grow to the same size
# as the input.
#
# Running the LeetCode tests does not give the expected result, this
# code performs worst than the previous one, it is probably due to the
# values used for testing. My guess is that a high percentage of the
# test words are not a match, in that case, the previous solution should
# perform better because it will fail as soon as a character not match,
# without checking the rest of the word. This solution will process
# each character in each word before deciding that it is not a match,
# that is probably compensating the extra performance that we are
# getting from the C code.
