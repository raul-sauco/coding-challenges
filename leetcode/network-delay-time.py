# Use Dijkstra's algorithm to visit all the nodes saving the time it
# takes for the signal to arrive to any given node, return the maximum
# or -1 if the signal fails to reach all the nodes.
#
# Time complexity: O(e+n*log(n)) - Comes from Dijkstra's algorithm.
# Space complexity: O(e) - The adjacency list will contain all edges,
# the priority queue could as well.
#
# Runtime: 558 ms, faster than 82.49%
# Memory Usage: 16.1 MB, less than 69.91%
