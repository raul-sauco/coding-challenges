import timeit
from typing import List


# Sort the balloons, then view them as intervals, each interval needs to
# be "hit" by, at least, one arrow. We can choose the first interval
# that has not been hit already and shot at its end point, then move to
# the next interval, if its start point is before/equal to the shot, it
# can be hit as well, we also need to check its end point and adjust
# the shot to make sure we also hit this new balloon shot = min(shot, end)
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - The sorting step has the highest
# complexity, once sorted, we visit each balloon in the input once and
# do constant time operations with it.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Sorting in Python takes space.

# Runtime 1333 ms Beats 86.96%
