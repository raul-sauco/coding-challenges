# The iterative solution is the most efficient on LeetCode, using the
# built-in method index is the most efficient locally.
#
# BuiltIn             0.01493   seconds
# Iterative           0.02365   seconds
# Recursive           0.04586   seconds


# Use a left and right pointer, at each iteration compute the mid-point
# between them, when the value at that mid index is greater than the
# target, we know that the target will be to the left if it found in the
# array, when the value is lesser, it will be found to the right.
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - Each iteration discards half of the
# search space.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant space.
