# Use an extra auxiliary vector of the same size as the input vector to
# store the candy assigned to each child initialized to 1 for each child.
# Iterate over the input array forward, for each child that has a higher
# rating that the one to its left, give it one more candy that the one to
# its left already has. Once we reach the end we traverse backwards, for
# each child that has a higher rating than the one to its right, if its it
# not already getting more candy than the one to its right is, we give it
# the amount of candy that that one gets plus 1. We return the sum of
# values in the assigned candy array.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We traverse over n elements twice.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We store an extra vector of size n in memory.

# Similar solution that only uses one pass, keep track of how many
# previous children's assignments depend on the current child, if it is
# necessary to increase its assigned candy, increase it by one for it
# and all previous children that had a higher rating.

# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each of the n elements once and do
# constant time work for each.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant extra memory.
