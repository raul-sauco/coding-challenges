# The classic backtracking solution to sub-sequence type problems. Start
# at the first element of the array and split into two branches, one
# that uses it and one that skips it, for each element after that, we
# chose to skip it and keep building the sequence and, if its value does
# not break the non-decreasing property of the sequence, we create
# another branch that uses the element.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*2^n) - The decision tree splits in two at each
# level and it has a max of n levels, for each of the 2^n possible
# sequences, we iterate over all its elements, a max of n, to convert
# them into a tuple hash them and add them to the set.
# Space complexity: O(n*2^n) - The number of subsequences that could be
# in the set.

# A pretty neat solution by StefanPochmann, it is faster than the
# previous solution, probably because using a set comprehension makes
# the logic run in C. It does run slower for local tests where the input
# array is an increasing sequence of numbers from 1 to 15.
