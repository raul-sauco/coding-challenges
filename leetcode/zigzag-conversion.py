# Follow the steps of the problem exactly as they are given, easy to
# visualize solution but not very performant.
#
# Compute the direction we are going, down or up, and calculate the
# position of the character in the matrix based on the constraints given.
# When going down, character will be placed below the last one, when
# going up, character will be placed on the position diagonally right
# and up from the last one.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - we iterate over the number of elements in the
# matrix 3 times, to create the matrix, to put each character in its
# position in the matrix, and to create the result string.
# Space complexity: O(n*m) - the matrix grows proportionally to both the
# size of the string and the number of rows.
#
# The space complexity could be optimized calculating the number of
# columns needed after half of the elements go in the same column and
# the other half in consecutive columns.
#
# Runtime: 336 ms, faster than 10.15%
# Memory Usage: 21.2 MB, less than 5.04%

            if go_up:
                # While moving up, increase the column and row count
                col += 1
                row -= 1

                # When moving down, do not increase the column count,

        # result = ""
        # for row in matrix:
        #     result += "".join(row)
        # return result


# This solution improves on the above one realizing that we don't really
# use the col position of the elements, we only care to know which row,
# and after which character, they are on. Instead of using a matrix, we
# can save time and space by using an array of strings as the matrix and
# appending each character to the corresponding row-string.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We go over each character in the string once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We store all characters in the string in the
# rows array
