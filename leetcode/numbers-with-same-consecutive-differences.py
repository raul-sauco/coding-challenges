# Treat each digit as a level of BFS, on each level, visit each element
# and add to the next level 0, 1 or 2 combinations of that element with
# a new digit with differences +k and -k appended to it.
#
# When When 1 <= k <=4:
# Time complexity: O(2^n) - On each level we may end up with twice the
# number of elements that we had in the previous level.
# Space complexity: O(2^n) - The deque may grow to that size, even if we
# don't take into account the input and output, the deque is not
# the real output because we are casting to list.
#
# # When When k == 0 or k > 4:
# Time complexity: O(n) - Each level will only have one element, because
# no matter the value of the last digit, there will be only one valid
# digit that we can add to it.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Any level can have a maximum of 9 elements,
# in fact, the number of elements will tend to decrease with bigger
# values of n and k.
