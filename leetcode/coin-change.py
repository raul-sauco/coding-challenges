# TODO add the memoization solution.

# We can use a bottom-up approach to find the solution. We can use an
# array dp with size amount initialized with MAX_INT. For each position
# and each coin value, we check how many coins we would need to get
# there if that was the last coin we had used. If we are at index i,
# then we check the value dp[i-coin] against the current best that we
# have in dp[i], if using the coin that we are visiting results in a
# better path, we update the best path on dp[i].
#
# Time complexity: O(n*amount) - First we sort on O(n*log(n)), then we
# visit each index of dp, of size len(amount) and, for each, possibly
# visit all the coins.
# Space complexity: O(amount) - Our DP array has size amount + 1.

# Runtime: 2455 ms, faster than 42.18%
