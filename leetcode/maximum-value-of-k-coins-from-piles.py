# Use an array of size k+1 to store computed results, iterate over each
# pile and each value i in the range k..0, dp[i] represents the best
# way we have found to pick i coins at the current pile, we can update
# dp[i] as the best way to pick between 0 and k coins from the current
# pile, or between 0 and all the coins if len(pile) < k.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*min(n,k)*k) - Where m is the number of piles, n
# is the max number of coins in any pile and k is the number of coins
# that we can pick in total.
# Space complexity: O(max(n,k)) - The dp array has size k+1, we also
# use an array of prefix sums for each pile with a max size of n.
