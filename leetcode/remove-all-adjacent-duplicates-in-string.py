# 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String
# ðŸŸ¢ Easy

# Tags: String - Stack

import timeit


# Iterate over the input string's characters pushing them into a stack,
# before pushing them, we compare the current character with the top of
# the stack, if they are the same, we pop the top of the stack and not
# push the current character.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each character once to assess it and
# a maximum of 2 times to push it into, and pop it from the stack.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack could grow to the same size as the
# input.
#
# Runtime: 70 ms, faster than 97.15%
# Memory Usage: 14.7 MB, less than 86.70%
