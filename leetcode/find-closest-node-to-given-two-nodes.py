# We can compute the distance between the start nodes and all other
# nodes using BFS, since the nodes have, at most, one outgoing edge, we
# don't need to use a queue or stack and can simply keep a pointer to
# the next node. Compute all distances from one of the start nodes, then
# compute the distances from the other node while checking if the
# current node has the minimum maximal distance to either node1 or node2.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate twice over a max of all the nodes
# in the input.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We keep two arrays of size n and a few
# pointers.
