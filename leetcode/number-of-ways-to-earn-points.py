# The recursive memoized solution, define a function that takes in an
# index, the number of values of that type that we can still use, and a
# target, and returns the number of different ways that we can arrive at
# that target from that state. At each level of the call stack we make
# two calls, that would be O(2^n) without memoization, using memoization
# the maximum number of calls equals the number of different arguments
# that the function can receive, that is n*max(count)*t, the number of
# questions * the maximum value of count * the possible values that
# the target can take 0..t.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*c*t) -  n: the number of questions * c: the
# maximum value of count * t the possible values that the target can
# take 0..t.
# Space complexity: O(min(n*c, t)) - The execution branch where we take
# all the questions possible would have a call stack of height n*c if
# the target was big enough to not go to zero after taking all the
# available points, otherwise the call stack height would be limited by
# the value of target.
#
# This solution fails with Time Limit Exceeded.
