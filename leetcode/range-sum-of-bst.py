# We can use the value of the root node to determine which subtrees need
# to be explored and wether the current node's value needs to be added.
# The recursive function calls itself, it could also have a nested
# recursive function that performed the search, if we wanted to avoid
# having to pass the low and high parameters in each call.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Each node is visited, at most, once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack can grow to the size of the
# height of the tree, if skewed, it could be the same as its size.
