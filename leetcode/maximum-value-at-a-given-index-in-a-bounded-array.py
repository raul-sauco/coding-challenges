import timeit


# The problem is asking us for the maximum value, to compute the sum of the
# array, we need to try different values, if we do that sequentially, we will
# need O(n*o) where n is the number of possible values and o is the cost of
# computing the sum given a value. If we use binary search, we can reduce that
# to O(log(n)*o) where n is again the number of possible values that we need to
# try. In this problem, we can choose to construct the minimum possible array
# given the value that we are trying, that array will be, given the conditions,
# a decreasing by 1 sequence in both sides of the value that we are trying
# because we want to maximize that one value while minimizing the sum of
# values in the array. We can use the arithmetic progression formula to compute
# the sum of values in the array in O(1)
#
# Time complexity: O(log(k)) - Where k is the number of possible values that
# we need to try and it is equal to maxSum.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant extra memory.
