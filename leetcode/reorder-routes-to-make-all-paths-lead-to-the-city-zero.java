  /**
   * Since we have n-1 roads and we are guaranteed that we will be able to
   * reach the root from all nodes after reversing some, or none, roads,
   * that means that there is one road between any two nodes. We can use
   * two structures, a set of nodes that we have visited, and a stack, or
   * queue, or nodes that are able to get to the root node, as well as a
   * counter of the number of connections that we need to reverse. We start
   * by visiting 0 and checking all the roads that are connected to it, any
   * road that leads away from 0, will need to be reversed, we do it, and
   * add the node at the end of that road to the stack to be processed
   * because that node now can access the root node, when the road leads to
   * the node that we are visiting, we add the source node to the stack to
   * be processed.
   *
   * Time complexity: O(n) - Even though we have nested loops, the inner
   * loop will run only a total of 2*(n-1) times, which is the number of
   * connections that we have in our "roads" structure .
   * Space complexity: O(n) - The roads structure will have 2*(n-1)
   * elements, the stack could grow to size n and the set will grow to size
   * n because we will visit all nodes.
   *
   * Runtime 63 ms Beats 65%
   * Memory 8.5 MB Beats 95%
