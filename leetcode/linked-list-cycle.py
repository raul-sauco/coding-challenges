# Use the fast and slow pointer cycle detection algorithm.

#
# Time complexity: O(n) - The complexity is linear over the number of
# nodes in the list.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant extra space.

# If the list nodes are hashable, or if they have unique values that we
# can hash, we can use a set, or a hashmap of value: node, to add
# nodes to, if we see a node that is already in the hash set, we can
# return true because that is the start of the cycle.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Linear time if we consider hashing O(1).
# Space complexity: O(n) - The set can grow to size n.
