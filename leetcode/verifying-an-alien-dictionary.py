# Create a hashmap with the characters pointing to the ordinal value,
# then iterate over the words in the input using the hashmap to check
# the words one character at a time until we find a tie-breaker.
#
# Time complexity: O(m+n) - Where m is the number of characters in order
# and it is limited to 26, we iterate over them to create the o dict.
# n is the combined number of characters in words, we could iterate over
# all of them depending on the input. Equivalent to O(n) because m <= 26
# Space complexity: O(m) ~ O(1) - The dictionary takes m space with
# m <= 26.
