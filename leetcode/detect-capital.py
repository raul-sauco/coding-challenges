# Make sure that the string has at least two letters, then look at these
# two characters to determine if the entire string needs to be upper or
# lowercase, once determined, check the rest of the string from 1..n to
# make sure that it complies.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We look at the first two positions twice, then
# once at the remaining positions.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant extra memory

# Use regex to determine if the string follows one of the three valid
# patterns, all uppercase, capitalized or lowercase.
#
# Time complexity: O(n)? - I haven't checked the implementation but,
# probably, this particular regex without any lookahead or lookbehind
# runs in linear time.
# Space complexity: O(1)? - I also am not sure, the expression needs to
# be compiled which must be constant space, then it will check probably
# one character at a time, but if the engine needs to copy the input,
# then the complexity would be O(n).
