# We could use an enum to make the code easier to read but it makes it
# a little less efficient because it need to create the object.
class Direction(Enum):
    RIGHT = "right"
    LEFT = "left"


# Use any traversal method to visit all nodes, for each node, record the
# direction that we used to travel there and the length of the zig-zag
# path to it, the path will continue to grow for one of its children and
# will restart for the other one.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit all nodes and do O(1) work for each.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack can grow to size n.

# Runtime 367 ms Beats 89.1%
# Memory 26.7 MB Beats 95.60%
