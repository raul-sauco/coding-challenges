    /// each element on nums, compute its "pair value" and check the count of times that we have
    /// seen it previously, we can form a pair for each time we have seen that value. After that,

    /// found in the hashmap.

    /// Time complexity: O(m*n) - We need to visit each digit m in the n values in the input.
    /// Space complexity: O(n) - The counts hashmap has the same size as the input.
