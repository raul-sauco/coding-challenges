# Sort the tasks by enqueue time then processing time, use a heap to
# efficiently pick the next task that we need to process when there are
# several candidates, use a variable to simulate the current time to
# determine which tasks are available.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We need to sort the tasks, we also
# iterate over the tasks and pick one at O(log(n)) cost, if all tasks
# where available from the start, that would also be O(n*log(n)) cost.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The sorted tasks array has the same size as
# the input array, the heap could also reach the same size.
