# Use Breadth-First search, start at the source node and queue all
# neighbors, recursively queue their neighbors, marking them as seen,
# until we either arrive at the destination vertex or run out of
# vertexes to explore.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We will visit each node once at max.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The queue will grow to O(v) depending on the
# connectivity of the graph, but the seen set could grow to the same
# size as the input - 1 if there were no path from source to destination.

# We are only interested in determining whether two vertexes are

# parents, if the parents are the same, the nodes are connected.

# edge we need to find the parents of both vertex connected by the edge,
# this will initially require up to v calls to find parent where v is the
# number of vertexes between the current ones and their parents, but, as
# more vertexes are grouped, we will start to hit parents as immediately
# averaging O(log(v)) per parent find.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The parents array is of size n.
