# Store all positions that hold 1s in each matrix in a list. Then
# iterate over each combination of positions in the list computing the
# vector between them and adding 1 to the count of times that we have
# seen the given vector. The solution to the problem will come from
# shifting the matrix using the most common vector and it will equal the
# number of positions in a and b that have that vector in common.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^4) - In the worst case each position in both
# matrixes would have a 1 O(n^2) and we would check each combination of
# them O((n^2)*(n^2)).
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - Either list and also the dictionary could
# grow to size n*n.

# There is an interesting solution that flattens the positions with ones
# in both matrixes into lists and then checks their difference, the
# concept is similar to the previous solution but I thought that it was
# interesting enough to add it here.

# Time complexity: O(N^4) - The original post gives it as O(AB + N^2)
# with A and B the number of 1s in A and B, as the number of 1s grows in
# the matrixes, A*B approaches n^4.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - The original post gives it as O(A+B) which
# becomes O(n^2) when the entire matrix is made of 1s.
