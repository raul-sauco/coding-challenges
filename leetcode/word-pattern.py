# We need to make sure that there is a direct correlation between
# characters in the pattern and words in s, we can use a dictionary
# mapping them, when we see a new character, we check that its matching
# word has not been seen and add it to both the set of seen words and
# the dictionary mapping characters to words. If ever we see a new
# character but we have seen the word, or the mappings between character
# and word do not match, we can return False.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of characters in s, the
# split function needs to visit all characters in s to find the
# delimiters, after that the algorithm runs in O(m) where m is the
# number of characters in pattern/words in s, if these are different,
# the algorithm exits quickly.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionary of character: word will grow
# to hold all characters in the input.
