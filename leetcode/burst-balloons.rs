    /// problems, taking the last balloon bursted as the split point to divide
    /// the array into two. For each subproblem, defined by the left and right

    /// last balloon bursted and computing the subproblems to the left and
    /// right. For each subproblem (l,r) we will store the optimal way of
    /// solving it in the dp array, to avoid doing repeated work.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n^3) - We have three levels of nested loops
    /// that go over n-2 elements each at most.
    /// Space complexity: O(n^2) - The dp array has size (n+2)^2.
