# Use recursion, check that the values at the current node match, if
# they do not, we can return false. If they do match, we need to explore
# the right and left subtrees recursively both flipping them and keeping
# them in their original form.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - At every node, we will check two branches,
# flipping the children and not flipping the children, but one of them
# will fail immediately O(1) because values are unique, otherwise, it
# would be O(2^n)
# Space complexity: O(h) - Where h is the height of the tree, that is
# the space used by the call stack.
