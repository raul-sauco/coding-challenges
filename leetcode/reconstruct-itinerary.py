# Create a dictionary of source: sorted_destinations, starting from JFK
# try visiting the possible destinations in lexicographical order until
# an itinerary that visits all the edges, or uses all the given tickets,
# is found, when we find that itinerary, return it. Anytime we arrive
# at a dead-end on the branch that we are exploring, we backtrack to
# the latest point where we made a decision and choose the next option
# until all the options on that branch have been exhausted, then we try
# another branch from higher in the recursion tree.
#
# Time complexity: O(v*e) - At most we will explore the combinations of
# v vertex and e edges.
# Space complexity: O(v+e) - The dictionary can grow to v+e size, the
# call stack will have a max height of v+1.
#
# Runtime: 81 ms, faster than 96.47%
# Memory Usage: 14.5 MB, less than 57.86%
