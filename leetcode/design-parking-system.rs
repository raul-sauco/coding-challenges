/// Keep a record of how many places in total are available and full, when a
/// car tries to park, return true and increase the number of vehicles of the
/// given type by 1 if the parking lot has not reached capacity for the given
/// type. For this problem we could only store the number of available spots,
/// but, if we wanted to update the functionality in the future, for example
/// let cars drive out, it would be useful to know the capacity at any point.
///
/// Time complexity: O(1) - Each call to both the new and add methods takes O(1).
/// Space complexity: O(1) - We store two arrays of 3 u16 each.

/// Runtime 12 ms Beats 84.31%
/// Memory 2.6 MB Beats 7.84%
