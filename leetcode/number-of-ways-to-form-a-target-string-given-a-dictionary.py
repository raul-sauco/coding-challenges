# Precompute the frequencies of characters at a given index of words,
# then we can explore the recursion tree, at each index, we can choose
# to pick a character from the current column, which we can do in as
# many ways as instances of the character at target[i] there are, or
# skip this column.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n + m*t) - We build a dictionary with character
# frequencies found at each index, to build it, we visit each character
# in the input array words in O(m*n), then we call the dfs function that
# can be called a maximum of m*t times where m is len(words[0]) and t
# is len(target).
# Space complexity: O(m*t) - The number of entries that we can store
# in the cache is m*t.
