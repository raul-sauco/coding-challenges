# Top down dynamic programming solution, visit all elements in nums1,
# for each, find the furthest left element in nums2 that we could match
# it with and call the function recursively with two options, using and
# skipping that possible line. Return the max result between each of the
# options.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n^2) - It looks like this solution could be
# O(2^n) because, at each step, we make a binary decision, and we have n
# steps, but the fact that we use dynamic programming to store computed
# result takes the complexity down to the number of possible call
# parameters.
# Space complexity: O(m*n^2) - The cache can hold a maximum of of one
# entry for each option of different call parameters.
