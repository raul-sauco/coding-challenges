# Create a dictionary with lines as the keys and all the points that
# belong to a line as the values. To define a line, we use its slope and
# y-intercept values, this uniquely identifies all lines formed by any
# two points in the input. Once we have assigned each point to all the
# lines where it belongs, we check which line has the most points.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - For each pair of points a, b, we compute its
# slope and y-intercept values to use as keys and add them to the lines
# dictionary.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - The lines dictionary could potentially
# have an entry for each combination of two points in the input.

# Improve the previous solution only storing the number of points per
# slope per each point, instead of all the points combinations. This
# solution has the same time complexity in theory, but it performs much
# better because it only needs to perform an addition, instead of
# hashing a tuple, when we add an element to the count. The memory
# complexity is obviously much better because we only store n entries
# in the dictionary, recreating it for each point a and only storing the
# slopes that it forms with all other points b, O(n) instead of all the
# combinations of a and b, like the previous solution in O(n^2).

# Time complexity: O(n^2) - For each pair of points a, b, we compute its
# slope and y-intercept values to use as keys and add them to the lines
# dictionary.

# have an entry for each point in the input.
