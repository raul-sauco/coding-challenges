# Intuition, the problem asks for the value of the right-most node of
# each level, ordered by level, this is an almost perfect fit for BFS.
# We can explore the tree and ignore all values except the last one for
# each level.
#
# Time complexity O(n) - we visit each node once.
# Space complexity O(n) - one level at a time in the queue, in a binary
# tree, this could be a max of n/2 nodes.

# Runtime: 70 ms, faster than 9.60%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 69.82%
