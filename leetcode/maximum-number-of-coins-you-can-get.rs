    /// value. The reasoning is that Alice will always keep the coin with the most value out of the
    /// remaining ones, since we want to maximize our total. To maximize the remaining total, we
    /// give Bob the smallest remaining coin. The easiest way to implement the algorithm is to sort
    /// the input, skip n/3 values that Bob will take, then take every second value, the result
    /// would be the same as if in each step we gave the highest to Alice, we took the next
    /// highest, and gave Bob the lowest.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting has the highest TC, linear time, once the vector is
    /// sorted, to collect every second highest value.
    /// Space complexity: O(n) - The local copy of the input that we sort.
