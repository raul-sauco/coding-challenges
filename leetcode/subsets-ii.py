# Count the number of unique digits, for each one, add it 0 to count

# Time complexity: O(2^n) - The number of different subsets that we may
# need to generate.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of unique keys in the
# input. All data structures and the call stack will have that size. If
# we want to count the output array res, then O(2^n).
