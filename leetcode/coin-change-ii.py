# Use DFS to explore two paths at each point, using and not using the
# current coin value, once we decide to not use a current coin value, we
# cannot go back and decide to use it at a later step, this avoids
# having duplicate results like (1,2,2) and (2,1,2).
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - With m the number of coins and n the target
# amount, we can see that we will call dfs with a maximum of m*n
# combinations of arguments, since repeated calls will be stored, they
# will not be recomputed.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The size of the memo object. The call stack
# can grow to size max(m,n).

# Runtime: 980 ms, faster than 38.77%
# Memory Usage: 164.9 MB, less than 6.42%

# Using a dp[i][j] we can store the number of ways to make up amount j
# using coins[:i], we can initialize all rows[0] like dp[i][0] = 0 which
# means that there is exactly one way to make up amount 0 with the given
# choice of coins: not using any of them. Then we can compute any
# dp[i][j] like the sum of the ways to make up j without using the last
# coin i: dp[i-1][j] plus the ways to make up j - coin using the same
# combination of coins: dp[i][j-coins[i-1]]
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We iterate over the number of coins and, in
# the inner loop, over 0..amount.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The size of the dp object.

# We can optimize the memory complexity of the previous solution, if we
# notice that we only ever need to access the results of: the same value
# of j and previous row, and previous values of j in the same row. That
# means that we can keep all the data we need in one array of size
# amount and overwrite it as we go because we will never need the values
# that we are overwriting after we used once.
