    // The max profit will come from buying at the lowest price possible and
    // selling at the highest possible price after that lowest price. We can
    // keep a variable with the lowest price that we have seen so far, for
    // each element, first we check if its value is less than the current
    // lowest price, if it is, we update lowest price and move to the next
    // element, if it isn't, we check if the profit of buying at the current
    // lowest price and selling at this price is better than the current
    // maximum profit, if it is, we update it. Once we iterate over all
    // prices, we return the maximum profit found.
    //
    // Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each price once and do O(1) work.
    // Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant extra memory.
