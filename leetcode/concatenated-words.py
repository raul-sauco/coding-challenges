# We can create a dictionary of words keyed by their lengths, then we
# iterate over the input words, for any word that is long enough to be
# a concatenation of other words, we try to build by checking all the
# slices that are of a length that has an existing word, if the slice
# is found in the dictionary, we continue building, if we get to the
# end of the word, we have found that all its substrings are smaller
# words in the input.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of characters in the
# input. We have to read all the characters to create the initial
# dictionary, then we sort the keys in O(k*log(k)) where k is the number
# of unique word lengths in the input and it is guaranteed to be less
# than n, then we iterate over all words taking slices and checking if
# the slices can be found in the dictionary, this is also O(n).
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionary holds all the characters in
# the input words.
