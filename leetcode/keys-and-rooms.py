# Use a stack, a queue would work as well, to store rooms for which we
# have gotten the keys but have not visited yet, visit them by popping
# them from the stack and, for each key found for a room we have not
# visited yet, add it to the stack and mark the room as visited.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We will visit all rooms once at most.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The visited array and the stack will grow in
# size linearly with the size of the input.

# Runtime 70 ms Beats 89.18%
# Memory 14.4 MB Beats 57.55%
