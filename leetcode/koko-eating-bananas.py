# It isn't evident, but this problem can be solved using binary search
# if we think of it in terms of: we are looking for a number between
# two others such that koko can finish all her bananas.
# We know that we need to eat, at least, 1 banana. The right
# boundary is the number of bananas in the biggest pile, because we
# know that we can finish the piles eating one per hour.
#
# Time complexity: O(p*log(b - p)) - b: max number of bananas in pile,
# p: number of piles.
# Space complexity: O(1)
#
# Runtime: 667 ms, faster than 57.73%
# Memory Usage: 15.6 MB, less than 24.04%
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        # Define a helper function that determines whether koko can
        # finish all the bananas at a given speed.
        def canFinish(k: int) -> bool:
            # Iterate through the piles subtracting, for each pile, the
            # amount of hours that koko will use to finish it up.
            remaining = h
            for p in piles:
                # Ceiling division, faster to use integer division than
                # remaining -= math.ceil(p / k)
                # https://stackoverflow.com/a/17511341/2557030
                remaining += p // -k
                # If we determine that koko cannot finish all the piles
                # at rate k, return false.
                if remaining < 0:
                    return False
            # Koko would be able to finish the piles at rate k.
            return True

        # Set the search boundaries.
        left, right = 0, max(piles)
        # We are looking for the lowest number that fulfills the
        # requirements, similar to First Bad Version.
        while right > left + 1:
