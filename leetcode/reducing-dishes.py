# Solving the problem efficiently becomes easy once we make a few
# observations, it is always better to take all positive values, it is
# also always better to put greater values to the right, so we can start
# by taking all positive values sorted and multiplied by their indexes + 1
# Then, every time we add a negative value, it is better to pick the
# greater one (closer to zero) and try it on the furthest left index, 0.
# The result of adding that value will be adding the negative value * 1 to
# the result, and shifting all the previous values to the right one
# position, which we can compute as being equal to the current sum of
# values in the vector. If the result of adding this value is a gain, do
# it, otherwise, stop trying to add values and return the result.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting the positive and negative values
# vectors has the highest complexity, everything else is O(n) we iterate
# over the values to split them into positive and negative, iterate over
# the positive values to create the initial sum and result and then
# iterate over the negative values checking if it is worth adding them in
# O(1) time.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The positive and negative vectors.
