# Use binary search to determine the minimum size of ship that lets us
# ship all the weights in the given amount of time. The binary search
# uses an auxiliary function to determine whether shipping is feasible
# given a ship size.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Linear time over the number of weights
# to determine whether a ship size is suitable and log(n) over the
# ship sizes, bounded by the max weight on the bottom and the total
# weights on top, which makes it equivalent to n.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant extra space used.
