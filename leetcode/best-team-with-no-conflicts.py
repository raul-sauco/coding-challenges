# Create a sorted array of players represented by (score, age) then we
# can iterate over them, a max of 1000 iterations. We will keep a dp
# structure with the best total score that we have been able to find
# for a given maximum age, for each player, we iterate over the dp
# structure, if the oldest player is of the same age or younger than the
# current player, we could add this player to the team.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*1000) - For small values of n this will be
# the same as n^2, but for larger values of n it can be simplified as
# O(n*log(n)) because then the sorting step, instead of the loops, could
# present the highest complexity , we get this complexity sorting by
# score and using age as the key of the dp.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The sorted players array has the same size as
# the input, the dp structure could as well grow to the same size.

# Runtime 1989 ms Beats 63.83%

        # order of ascending scores, we need to check that we don't add
        # a player younger than the oldest in the branch.

                # given branch, we could add them.

# Once we sort the players by score, this problem becomes obtaining the
# sum of scores of players up to, and including, a given age that we
# have seen already. That makes this problem similar to range sum
# query mutable in that we need to efficiently update elements in an
# array and query sum ranges at that point, before we add any player
# with a higher score.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(a)) - Where n is the number of players and a
# is the max age in the input and it is limited to a max a 1000.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The sorted players array has the same size as
# the input, the binary indexed tree has size max(ages).
