# Simple solution that uses extra memory. Iterate over the input linked
# list nodes and store them in an array then pick random elements from
# the array in O(1) when needed.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Init iterates over the entire linked list,
# then O(1) for getRandom.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We use an array of size n of extra memory.

# Runtime 60 ms Beats 98.51%
# Memory 17.2 MB Beats 97.21%

    def __init__(self, head: Optional[ListNode]):
        self.vals = []
        while head:
            self.vals.append(head.val)

# Use reservoir sampling to lazily solve the problem, it only fetches
# nodes when required. For this problem it does not seem to make a lot
# of sense, but it is an interesting algorithm to be aware of. In this
# case, since we are iterating the entire list every time we call
# getRandom, it would make more sense to store the length of the list
# and then get a random value between 0..n and iterate up to that node
# to return its value.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - O(1) for init, then get random iterates over
# the entire list every time it is called.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant extra memory.
