    /// Sort the weights of the people that we need to save, then use two
    /// pointers, one for the heaviest person that needs to be saved and one
    /// for the lightest, if we can put them together on a boat, do so and
    /// shift both pointers, otherwise put the heaviest person alone in a boat
    /// and move only that pointer. This works because if the heaviest person
    /// cannot go on the boat together with the current lightest person, we
    /// know that it cannot also go with any other.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting has the most complexity, then
    /// arranging people on boats we can do in O(n).
    /// Space complexity: O(log(n)) - Sorting memory complexity in Rust.
    ///
    /// Runtime 10 ms Beats 100%
    /// Memory 2.5 MB Beats 92.31%
