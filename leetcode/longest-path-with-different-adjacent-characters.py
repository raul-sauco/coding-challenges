# Explore the tree using depth-first search, each node computes two
# maximum path values, the longest path that has this node as part of
# the path, and the longest path that uses this node as a root, we
# return the first value to the parent, together with the character at
# the node, and use the second to update a global max path value.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We will visit each node once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack will grow to the height of the
# tree, which could be n.
