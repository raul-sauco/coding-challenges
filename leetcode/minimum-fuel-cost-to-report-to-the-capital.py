# We can use a postorder DFS, each node returns the number of people
# traveling and the amount of gas consumed to get everyone there, the
# parent looks at the number of people and computes the cost of getting
# everyone from the child to itself, then adds up all the costs plus
# the representative starting the journey there and returns that
# information to the parent.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node twice, once in the
# traversal and once when computing the results using the children's
# returns.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack could grow to size n with a
# skewed tree.
