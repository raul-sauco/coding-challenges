# The naive solution does literally what the problem tells it to do, it
# iterates over every pair of words, switches their first characters and
# checks to see if any of the resulting words is already in the input.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We check every pair of words, for each, we
# swap their characters and hash them, but word length is limited to 10
# characters, so O(1) work.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The set that we use to check if a word is
# part of the input has the same size as the input.
#
# This solution fails with TLE.
class Naive:
    def distinctNames(self, ideas: List[str]) -> int:
        # Naive approach with O(n^2) time complexity.
        not_allowed = set(ideas)
        count, n = 0, len(ideas)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                w1 = ideas[i][0] + ideas[j][1:]
                w2 = ideas[j][0] + ideas[i][1:]
                if w1 not in not_allowed and w2 not in not_allowed:
                    count += 2
        return count


# This solution is based in two observations, words with the same first
# letters can never be combined amongst themselves, because they would
# not change and therefore are guaranteed to be in the input, we can
# put all words with the same characters into sets. Then we iterate over
# each pair of sets, check how many word suffixes are common between
# both sets, because they will also result in an existing word, and
# compute the number of ways to combine suffixes that are not common
# between themselves.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each word to build the dictionary,
# then iterate over the characters that we use as keys for the
# dictionary using a nested loop at O(26^2)â‰ˆO(1). Inside each of the 26^2
# loops we compute the intersection of sets, which overall can be at most
# O(n) work because that is the number of words in the combined sets,
# and do some math with the length of the sets and their intersection
# at O(1).
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionary contains all characters in the
# input.
