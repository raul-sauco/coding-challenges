# Since we have n-1 roads and we are guaranteed that we will be able to
# reach the root from all nodes after reversing some, or none, roads,
# that means that there is one road between any two nodes. We can use
# two structures, a set of nodes that we have visited, and a stack, or
# queue, or nodes that are able to get to the root node, as well as a
# counter of the number of connections that we need to reverse. We start
# by visiting 0 and checking all the roads that are connected to it, any
# road that leads away from 0, will need to be reversed, we do it, and
# add the node at the end of that road to the stack to be processed
# because that node now can access the root node, when the road leads to
# the node that we are visiting, we add the source node to the stack to
# be processed.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Even though we have nested loops, the inner
# loop will run only a total of 2*(n-1) times, which is the number of
# connections that we have in our "roads" structure .
# Space complexity: O(n) - The roads structure will have 2*(n-1)
# elements, the stack could grow to size n and the set will grow to size
# n because we will visit all nodes.
#
# Runtime 1132 ms Beats 98.48%
# Memory 41.5 MB Beats 93.33%
