    /// window technique were we store the last max_pts (mp) elements' sum, at
    /// each position, we compute the probability of ending with that exact
    /// number of points as the sum of the sliding window, the preceding mp
    /// values, divided by the size of the sliding window.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each position 1..=n and do O(1) work
    /// for each.
    /// Space complexity: O(n) - The size of the dp vector. If it was likely
    /// for max_pts to be much smaller than n, we could instead use a double
    /// ended queue as our dp object and pop the left elements as we iterate,
    /// that would let us use a max_pts-sized dp element.
    ///
    /// Runtime 0 ms Beats 100%
    /// Memory 2.1 MB Beats 100%
