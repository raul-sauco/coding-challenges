# Create a dictionary that stores the minimum number of stops needed to
# reach a given destination. Iterate once over the bus list adding
# every bus, except the one we can reach from the initial stop, if
# there is one, to a queue of buses waiting to be processed.
# Start processing buses from the queue, we will be able to reach the
# bus if one of its stops is reachable, then we can add that bus stops
# to the dictionary of reachable bus stops.
# If during one loop the queue does not decrease in size, we can exit
# the loop and return -1, we won't be able to reach any more stops.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - n: number of bus stops. The number of times
# we will visit each bus stop has a relation with the ordering of the
# routes, if the input was already ordered in the way we would travel
# through the bus routes, we would only need to visit each bus stop once
# O(n) time complexity, but if the only route we could visit each time
# was the last one on the queue, we would visit each bus stop before
# adding the last one, on each loop, O(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(n) - Both the dictionary and the queue will have
# the same size as the input.
#
# Runtime: 656 ms, faster than 71.60%
# Memory Usage: 29.9 MB, less than 91.27%
