# Similar to two sum but create entries for each sum of pairs of
# elements in O(n^2) time and space, and use these sums to find matching
# quadruplets, when found, we can add them to the result set as a sorted
# tuple to eliminate duplicates.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^3) - First we iterate three times over the input
# to eliminate any elements that appear more than four times, then we
# iterate over each pair of elements computing their sum and checking
# to see if their complementary sum has been seen already, if the
# complementary is found, it points to a list of pairs that sum up to
# that complementary, that list could be of length n although the
# probability is low, that is three levels of nesting n calls at worst.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - The sums dictionary could have an entry for
# each pair of elements in the input.
