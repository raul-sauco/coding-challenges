import timeit


# Use a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Iterate over all the
# positions in the input string checking the character at that position
# while keeping track of the current state. States can be: "reading a
# word" and "skipping blanks". If we are reading the characters of a
# word and find a blank, we append the word to the result array and
# reset the current word to an empty array.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate over all the characters in the
# input array several times, to read them, to build the word and to
# build the result.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We store all characters in the words array.
#
# Runtime: 33 ms, faster than 95.34%
# Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 78.97%

# Python has built-in functions that make this problem quite trivial, it
# would be good to, at least, be aware of them and mention them in an
# interview, even when also providing the other solution.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Each of the built-in functions still need to
# read the entire string.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The entire input is loaded into memory to
# manipulate.

# Runtime: 37 ms, faster than 90.50%
# Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 48.44%
