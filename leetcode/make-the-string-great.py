# Iterate over the elements of the input string pushing them into a
# stack, if the element that we visit is the uppercase or lowercase
# counterpart of the last element on the stack, pop that element.

# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of characters in the
# input.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack could have n elements where n is
# the number of characters of the input.
