    // The problem lets us do two operations on the input array elements,
    // for even numbers, it lets us divide them by 2 as long as they remain
    // even, for odd numbers, we can multiply them by 2 once, then they
    // become even. To simplify the problem, we can start by multiplying all
    // odd values by 2, that way each element is at the maximum it can be,
    // and them pushing them all into a max heap after checking the value
    // of the smallest item in the heap. While we can make the biggest
    // current element smaller, that is while the top of the heap is even,
    // and we can divide it by 2, we will pop that element and compute the
    // current difference between it and the smallest element currently in
    // the heap, if the gap is the smallest seen so far, we will record it as
    // the temporary result, then we divide the value by 2 and push it back
    // into the heap. When we find an odd element as the top of the heap, we
    // know that we cannot make it any smaller and so we can stop iterating.
    //
    // Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - We may pop and push all elements in the
    // input array a certain number of times t, t has a logarithmic relation
    // to the value of the element and its upper bound is 30 because of
    // log2(10^9), therefore time complexity is n*30*log(n) and we can
    // simplify it.
    // Space complexity: O(n) - The heap will have the same size as nums.
    //
    // Runtime 85 ms Beats 79%
    // Memory 3 MB Beats 46%
