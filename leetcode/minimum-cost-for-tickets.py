# The brute force solution looks at each day in the days array and, for
# each, it checks the result of either of the three options, buy a day,
# week or month ticket.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^3) - There are n days and each day the decision
# tree splits in 3.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The call stack will reach a height of n.
#
# This solution probably fails with TLE.

# past plus the cost of a 1 day ticket. If we don't need to travel, we
# can maintain the same best cost as the day before.
