# Bottom-up DP. We initialize a row of size m with all values being
# equal to 1. This represents the possible ways to reach the destination
# from these positions. Then we iterate over the remaining rows of the
# matrix updating the possible ways to reach the destination from the
# given position.
#
# For each position, the possible ways to reach the destination are the
# sum of the position above plus the position to its left.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - we do one calculation for each position of
# the matrix mxn.
# Space complexity: O(n) - we store an array of size n in memory.

                    # The number of ways to reach the target from here
                    # are the sum of the ways to reach the target
                    # from the position to the right and the position
                    # below (inverted on the code for clarity).

# What the problem asks for is simply the number of ways we can combine
# a certain amount of 2 values,
# for example, if we call the down move 0 and the right move 1, the
# first example can be re-written to be:
# How many different ways can we combine 3 0s and 7 1s?
# That is a combination that can be calculated as C(10, 3)

#
# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - the factorial function is calculated as:
#
# > factorial(n) is written in the form 2**k * m, with m odd.  k and m
# > are computed separately, and then combined using a left shift.
#
# Python3 factorial implementation and comments:

#
# Space complexity: O(1) - But the result of factorial grows at a O(n!)
# rate, even limited by a size of n, m <= 100,
# the factorial of 200 is > 1e350 which is probably more space than
# needed for the 100 slot list used on the DP.
#
# The results running this code in LeetCode are a bit surprising, for me
# at least, I expected the code to run fast
# but use a lot of memory, but the result is the opposite.

# We can use functools.reduce to have python do the calculations in C,
# this method has the same O complexity but it is more efficient.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - we do one calculation for each position of

# Space complexity: O(m*n) - the memory used by reduce and the lambda
# will grow linearly with the size of the matrix.
