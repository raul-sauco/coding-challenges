# Time complexity: O(n^2) - If the array contains small values and they

# Space complexity: O(n^2) - The call stack.

# found.

# each position after itself.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionary could hold an entry for each
# element in nums.

# Intuition: Mark the end of the array as our point to reach (goal) and

# reach the current goal from there i + nums[i] >= goal mark that
# position as the new goal and check if we can reach it from any of the
# previous positions.
