    /// Sort the input, then use a sliding window technique, the sliding window
    /// is computed using the value of the left edge and the value that the
    /// right edge should have for the array to be continuous. When we find these
    /// two indexes, we know that the elements between these two indexes can be
    /// used as part of the continuous array, and we will need to change all
    /// the others. We try all left boundaries and keep the one that results in
    /// the least amount of substitutions.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting the input vector has the highest
    /// complexity, the sliding window algorithm runs in O(n) because r never
    /// moves backwards.
    /// Space complexity: O(n) - We keep a local copy of nums, in languages that
    /// let us mutate the input, we could sort the input vector. Besides that,
    /// we use, probably, O(log(n)) extra space for the sorting and constant
    /// extra space besides that.
