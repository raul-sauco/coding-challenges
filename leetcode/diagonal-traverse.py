import timeit

from typing import List


# Use the fact that row_idx + col_idx results in the same value for all
# elements in the same negative diagonals, which are the ones that the
# problem is asking us to find, to place all cell values into lists
# indexed by their row_idx + col_idx value. Then iterate over the
# entries in the dictionary, since Python 3.6 the dictionary guarantees
# that it will return the keys in the same order they were inserted on,
# which is guaranteed to be the same order we want because we visit
# lower row/column values first. The only extra step we need to take is
# to reverse all even diagonals to simulate the up/down travel.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each cell once to add its value to
# the dictionary and once to copy the value to the result.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionary will grow to the same size
# as the input.
#
# Runtime: 194 ms, faster than 95.96%
# Memory Usage: 17.9 MB, less than 27.87%
