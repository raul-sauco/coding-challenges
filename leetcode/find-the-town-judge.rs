    // We can solve this problem using topological sorting, count the
    // elements that are trusted by the current one and elements that the
    // current one trusts, return the element that does not trust any others
    // and is trusted by n-1 others.
    //
    // Time complexity: O(n+t) - Where n is n and t is the number of items
    // in the trust array. We iterate over all the elements in trust to
    // create the topological sorting, then iterate over a max of n elements
    // to find the one that matches the given conditions.
