# Counting the number of nodes in the tree can be done in two steps;
# determining the height of the tree and determining how many nodes
# there are on the last level, the first we can do finding the leftmost
# node in the last level, since we know that one will always have to be
# present, then we can do binary search on the last level to find the
# rightmost node.
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n)) - We travel the height of the tree reducing
# the search space in half every time.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Only pointers are used.

# Runtime: 83 ms, faster than 93.94%
# Memory Usage: 21.4 MB, less than 46.74%

        # Binary search the index of the first missing node on the last
        # level.
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            # If this node exists in the tree, adjust the search.

                r = mid - 1
        return l + (2**height) - 1


# The binary search solution is more intuitive, for me at least, but the
# problem can be solved with less code using a divide and conquer
# approach, from the given root, we check if the height traveling always
# left is the same as the height traveling always right, which is an
# easy way to check if the last level of the tree is full, if the level
# is full, we know that the tree is a perfect tree and has 2**h - 1
# nodes. If the tree is not full, we recursively call the function with
# its left and right subtree, since at each level, one of the subtrees
# will be a full tree, we will get a solution for half the problem in
# log(n) and will call the function log(n) times at a log(n) cost.
#
# Time complexity: O(log(n)^2) - Each call costs log(n) and there are
# log(n) calls.
# Space complexity: O(log(n)) - The call stack will grow to the height
# of the tree.
