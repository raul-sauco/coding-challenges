# Use iterative DFS to travel the tree keeping track of the highest
# value that we have seen in the current branch of the exploration.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Worst case would be a completely unbalanced
# tree, in which case we would push all nodes into the stack.
#
# Runtime: 307 ms, faster than 78.29%
# Memory Usage: 32.6 MB, less than 46.30%
