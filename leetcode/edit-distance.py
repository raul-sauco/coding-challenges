import timeit


# We can compute the edit distance of each substring of w1 from 0 to j
# and each substring of w2 from 0 to i based on whether the characters
# at w1[j] and w2[i] match. If they match, the edit distance will be the
# same as for the substrings w1[j-1], w2[i-1] because we won't need to
# edit the new character, if they don't match, the edit distance will be
# the best between [w1[j-1], w2[i-1]], [w1[j], w2[i-1]] and [w1[j-1],
# w2[i]] because we know that we can edit any of them to become w1[0..j],
# w2[0..i] with one edit, either remove, add or replace.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We compute dp for each combination of
# possible prefixes of the two input strings.
# Space complexity: O(m) - The dp array has the length of word1 + 1.
