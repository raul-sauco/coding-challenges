# The brute force solution explores all possible paths, to buy or not to
# buy when we don't hold any stock and to sell and not to sell when we
# do hold stock.
#
# Time complexity: O(2^n) - On each level the decision tree doubles in
# size.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Where n is the size of the prices list, the
# call stack can grow to a max of size n, limited to 5000.
#
# This solution would fail with Time Limit Exceeded.

# The memoized solution improves over the brute force version storing
# branches that have been computed to avoid repeated work. To do that
# we can use the functools @cache annotation.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - We compute each of the n^2 results once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Where n is the size of the prices list, the
# call stack can grow to a max of size n, limited to 5000.
