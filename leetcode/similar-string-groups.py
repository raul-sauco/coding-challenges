import timeit
from typing import List


# Create a disjoint set data structure. Iterate over every pair of
# input strings O(n^2) checking if they are similar by checking the
# number of positions at which they have different characters, when the
# strings are similar, we join their sets since we are guaranteed that
# we can use this pair to connect any other strings in their current
# disjoint groups. The answer is the number of disjoint groups.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n^2) - Where m is the number of characters of the
# input strings, they all have the same, and n is the number of input
# strings. We iterate over a pair of inputs, for each pair, we check
# m positions for equality.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Parents and ranks arrays have size n.
