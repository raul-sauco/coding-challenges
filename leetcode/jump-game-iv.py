# What we have is a connected undirected graph where we can use the
# element indexes as the vertex identifiers, we want to go from 0 to n-1
# in the minimum number of steps possible, we can use breadth-first
# search, to prepare for it, we can first create an adjacency list,
# each node's neighbors are the vertices before and after, and any other
# vertices with the same value.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We have three sections that visit each element
# on the input array and do constant work.
# Space complexity: O(n) - There are several data structures that take
# n memory.
#
# Runtime 670 ms Beats 96.59%
# Memory 27.7 MB Beats 91.87%
