# We can remove all stones except the last one, out of any groups that
# share row/column at any point. Then the algorithm becomes finding out
# how many groups there are and returning len(stones) - len(groups)
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Union find by rank with path compression has
# an amortized O(1) time complexity per union, and we do n unions where
# n is the number of stones in the input. Iterating over the stones
# adding each of them to the row and col dictionary is O(1) per stone.
# Space complexity: O(n) - We store one entry in the parents dictionary,
# one in the row dictionary and one in the column dictionary per stone.

# Runtime: 422 ms, faster than 46.48%
# Memory Usage: 15.2 MB, less than 34.06%

# Looking at the previous, complicated, solution, we can see a few
# places where we can make optimizations, the biggest one is that we are
# treating row and column groups as separate entities until the very end,
# if we could combine them earlier, it would make the algorithm simpler,
# we can union the row and column groups of any element that we find as
# they are guaranteed to be connected by this element, to differentiate
# the row and column numbers as group leaders, we can negate all column
# indexes.

# Time complexity: O(n) - Union find by rank with path compression has
# an amortized O(1) time complexity per union, and we do n unions where
# n is the number of stones in the input.

# per stone.
