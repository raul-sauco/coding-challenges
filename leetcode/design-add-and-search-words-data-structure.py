# Implement the word dictionary using plain hash maps to store the
# children of each node. Inserting is exactly the same as with the
# regular trie class and can be done in O(n), searching will need to
# branch out to all the nodes' children when the current character is a
# '.' wildcard and it could potentially take O(m*n) which is visiting
# each node in the trie, even though usually would be faster.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - For searching strings with wildcards, it
# could potentially search the entire trie. O(n) for inserts, it will
# perform one O(1) operation per character.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - Potentially, each character of each node
# inserted could make its own node, in average it will be less than that
# because words with common roots will share nodes.
#
# Runtime: 16919 ms, faster than 27.72%
# Memory Usage: 55.9 MB, less than 87.04%
