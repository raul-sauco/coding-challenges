    /// Similar concept to the first trapping rain water problem, the difference is that we need to
    /// keep track of the entire perimeter of the 3D matrix, where the 3rd dimension is the height,
    /// instead of only needing to keep track of the two ends. To determine where we can bring the
    /// perimeter in, we will use a min heap, implemented using a priority queue with the heights
    /// reversed. We start by adding the cells in the outer perimeter given that they cannot hold
    /// any water, then we iterate over the cell in the heap with the minimum height, pop it and
    /// check if it would hold any water, by checking its height against the previous min height of
    /// the current perimeter. If the cell height is less than the previous min height of the
    /// current perimeter cells, it would hold current min height - cell height water, if it is
    /// taller, then this is the new minimum height of the outer perimeter. Next we add any
    /// neighbors that we haven't visited yet to the min heap, marking them "seen" when we do.
    ///
    /// Time complexity: O(nmlog(nm)) - We will visit all cells and push-pop them from a heap of
    /// size m*n. We also iterate before that step to find the perimeter at m+n, but that gets
    /// trumped by the complexity of the while loop.
    /// Space complexity: O(mn) - Both the hashset and the priority queue can grow to the size of
    /// the matrix, depending on shape.
