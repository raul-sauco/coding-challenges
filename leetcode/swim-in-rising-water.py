# We can use a modified version of Dijkstra to solve this problem, we
# start at 0, 0 and start visiting its neighbors, each time we visit a
# neighbor, we compute the fastest time at which we can get there and
# push it, together with its coordinates, into a min heap, once we have
# visited all the neighbors of the current cell, we pop the next one
# from the heap. Since we are always popping the cell that we can visit
# fastest, we know that we will be updating their neighbors with the
# fastest time possible to arrive at that cell.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2*log(n)) - We may push and pop each cell into
# the heap at a log(n^2) cost, equivalent to 2*log(n).
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - Both the heap and the copy of the grid
# can, or do, have n*n elements.
#
# Runtime: 110 ms, faster than 93.76%
# Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 97.32%
