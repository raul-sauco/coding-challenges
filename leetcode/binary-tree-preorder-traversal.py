# Iterative version of the solution, process the current node, add the
# right child to the stack, then the left child, to make sure we
# process the left subtree before the right subtree.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We will visit each node once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The stack will grow in size linearly with the
# size of the input.

# Improve the space complexity of the previous solutions using the
# Morris Traversal algorithm, when a node has a right subtree, instead
# of adding its root to the stack, we slice it from its current
# position and add it as the right child of the rightmost child of the
# left subtree, that guarantees that we will visit that node only after
# we have visited all nodes of the left subtree.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once or twice.
# Space complexity: O(1) - We only keep two pointers in memory.
