# Use union-find to compute the number of disjoint sets and the number
# of redundant connections at the same time in O(e+n), the number of
# connections that we need to make is equal to the number of disjoint
# sets minus one, if the number of redundant connections is less than
# that, we cannot connect the network, return -1.
#
# Time complexity: O(v+e) - We iterate over all existing connections e
# to create the disjoint set structure, then iterate over all vertices v
# to compute the number of unconnected components.
# Space complexity: O(v) - We use two extra structures that are both of
# size v.
