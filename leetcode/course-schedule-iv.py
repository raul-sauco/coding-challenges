# Use topological sort to create an array where each entry i is a set
# with all the dependencies of the i-th course, direct and indirect ones,
# once we have that array, we can perform each query in O(1), given the
# constraints of the problem, it is better to use a bit more time
# building this data structure, even if the complexity of that is high,
# O(n^3+p) because we know that n <= 100 is a small value. After that
# the queries, of which we could have up to 10^4, can run in O(1).
#
# Time complexity: O(n^3 + p) - The last loop where we go along the
# topographical order processing nodes and creating the all_dependencies
# array has 3 nested loops all of which have an upper limit of n. The
# third loop is implicit, the copy of set elements from a dependency to
# the current node.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - The arrays of size n have elements which
# in turn are sets of size n.
#
# Runtime 738 ms Beats 87.53%
# Memory 18.1 MB Beats 11.16%
