# Iterate over the columns, then a nested loop iterates over the strings
# after the first one comparing that string/column character with the
# one on the same position on the previous string, if we find one
# character that does not follow the lexicographical order, we add one
# to the result and break out of the column loop.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We will visit each character in each string
# in the input.
# Space complexity: O(1) - Constant extra memory used.
#
# Runtime 162 ms Beats 75.16%
# Memory 14.5 MB Beats 93.5%

# Use zip to rearrange the strings into lists corresponding to the
# columns, then check that each character has a lexicographical value
# equal or more than the preceding one.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We will visit each character in each string
# in the input.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The zip(*strs) expression makes a copy of
# the input in memory.
