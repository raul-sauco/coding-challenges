# Tags: String - Union Find

import timeit


# Use union find by rank where the rank is the reversed lexicographical
# order of the characters to be joined.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of characters in the
# input, we visit all characters in s1 and s2 to construct the union
# find structure, then we visit all characters in base str to find their
# lexicographically smallest equivalents, the find parent operation runs
# in amortized O(1) because it uses path compression.
# Space complexity: O(1) - The parents dictionary can grow to size 26.
#
# Runtime 39 ms Beats 93.68%
# Memory 13.9 MB Beats 94.83%
