# Use depth-first search to visit all nodes in the tree, for each node,
# swap the position of its children.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node in the tree and, for each,
# do O(1) work.
# Space complexity: O(h) - The call stack can grow to the height of the
# tree, which could be the same as n.
#
# Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 96.89%
# Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 96.89%
