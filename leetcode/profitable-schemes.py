# Iterate over the indexes of the jobs, gang members and profit,
# computing the result of doing and skipping this job, if we go over
# the maximum allowed gang members, we return 0, this combination is
# not valid, if we reach the end of the array, we return 1 if we
# achieved the minimum profit and 0 if we didn't.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*mp*g) - Where n is the max number of gang members
# we can choose, mp is the minimum profit we need to make and g is the
# length of the profit and group arrays, these three are the ranges of
# the three parameters to the function that we are using to compute the
# results, since we are memoizing the function, that is the maximum
# number of times we may call it.
# Space complexity: O(n*mp*g) - The size of the cache, the call stack
# can grow to size g.
