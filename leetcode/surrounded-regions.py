# Visit all the cells around the perimeter, any cell with an "O" its
# enqueued to be processed and marked "safe" from capture. Once we are
# done with the perimeter, start visiting the cells in the queue marking
# them safe and enqueueing any adjacent cell that has an "O". When we
# run out of cells in the queue, we know that any other "O" cells are
# not safe from capture, we can visit all cells in the board, any cell
# with an "O" that has not been marked as "safe" gets captured.
#
# Time complexity: O(m*n) - We visit all cells in the board 1 or 2 times.
# Space complexity: O(m*n) - The queue can grow in size linearly with
# the size of the input.
#
# Runtime: 137 ms, faster than 97.70%
# Memory Usage: 15.2 MB, less than 91.46%
