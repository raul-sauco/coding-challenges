# The most adaptable solution is to use two counters to store all wins
# and loses of all the given players, then we can produce any results
# required based on the counters, for example, we could return all the
# players in order of more wins or "points".
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - The players need to be sorted before
# being returned.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The counters can grow to size n.
#
# Runtime: 4867 ms, faster than 21.40%
# Memory Usage: 68.8 MB, less than 58.91%
class UseCounter:
    def findWinners(self, matches: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        won, lost = Counter(), Counter()
        for w, l in matches:
            won[w] += 1
            lost[l] += 1
        return [
            sorted(set(won.keys() - set(lost.keys()))),
            sorted(x for x in lost.keys() if lost[x] == 1),
        ]


# Theoretical complexity can be improved if we use the count sort
# concept and an array to store intermediate results. We use the players
# ids as keys for the array and store the number of win/losses for any
# player that we see, then iterate over that array to generate the
# results in the desired format.
#
# Time complexity: O(k+n) - Where n is the number of matches in the
# input and k is the maximum number of players given to us in the
# description, 10^5.
# Space complexity: O(k) - The array k where we store intermediate
# results.

# Runtime: 3712 ms, faster than 66.77%
# Memory Usage: 70.6 MB, less than 8.18%

        results = [-1] * 100_001
        # Iterate over the matches storing the results.

            else:
                results[l] += 1
        # Iterate over the results constructing the winners and one
        # match lost arrays.
