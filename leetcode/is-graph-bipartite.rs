/// the opposite group, if we ever find two neighbors in the same group, return
/// false. If we ever run out of nodes in the queue, check to see if we have
/// any unvisited nodes, enqueue them and start again.
///
/// Time complexity: O(n+e) - We may travel n nodes at most to find all unique
/// disjoint components, for each component, we will travel, at most, n nodes
/// using breadth-first search. For each node visited, we will explore all its
/// edges, when they lead to an unvisited node, we will add it to the queue.
/// Space complexity: O(n) - The queue can hold one entry per node, the vector
/// of groups is size n.
