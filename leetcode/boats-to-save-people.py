# Sort the weights of the people that we need to save, then use two
# pointers, one for the heaviest person that needs to be saved and one
# for the lightest, if we can put them together on a boat, do so and
# shift both pointers, otherwise put the heaviest person alone in a boat
# and move only that pointer. This works because if the heaviest person
# cannot go on the boat together with the current lightest person, we
# know that it cannot also go with any other.
#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Sorting has the most complexity, then
# arranging people on boats we can do in O(n).
# Space complexity: O(n) - Sorting takes memory in Python.
#
# Runtime 453 ms Beats 84.42%
# Memory 20.9 MB Beats 60.46%
