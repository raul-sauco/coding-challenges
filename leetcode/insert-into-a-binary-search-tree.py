# Travel through the tree choosing to go right or left based on node
# values until we find the leave below which we will need to insert
# the new node.
#
# Time Complexity: Best: O(log(n)) Worst: O(n) - We will travel the
# entire height of the tree, ideally, it would be a well balanced tree
# and its height would be log(n), but a skewed tree could have a height
# of n, since we are not doing any balancing, after multiple inserts,
# depending on the order in which the values were inserted, the tree
# could become skewed.
# Space complexity: Best: O(log(n)) Worst: O(n) - Each node that we
# visit will add one call to the call stack, we could improve it to O(1)
# using an iterative method because we only need to keep a pointer to
# one node.
