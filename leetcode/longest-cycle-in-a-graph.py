# Use depth-first search starting from every node, keep visited nodes in
# a set to make sure we only visit each node once. Keep also a hashmap
# of sets that we have visited along the current path pointing to the
# position along the path at which we saw them, if we see a node that we
# already saw in the current path, we have found a cycle, the size of
# the cycle is the difference between the two positions at which we
# found the current node, if we get to a node that does not have any
# outbound edges, we can return 0 because the path will not have any
# cycles.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit each node once and do O(1) work,
# once a node is visited along one path, we will not visit it from
# another path, if a path leads to a node that was visited already, it
# will stop there.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The list of visited nodes and the dictionary
# of nodes seen along the path can both be of size n.
