import timeit
from typing import List


# Iterate over nums2 in reverse keeping track of the largest values that
# we have seen using a monotonic stack. For each value, we pop any
# smaller values of the stack then append it. We also use a hashmap to
# record which is the first greater element that we have seen after the
# current one, which will be the top of the stack. Once we have visited
# all elements of nums2, we iterate over nums1 using the dictionary to
# get the next greater value.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - We visit once each element in both arrays.
# Each element also may get pushed and popped from the stack once.
# Space complexity: O(n) - The dictionary will grow to the same size as
# nums2, the stack may as well grow to that size.
#
# Runtime: 98 ms, faster than 62.24%
# Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 56.75%
