# Sort both the edges and the queries using the edges weight and the
# queries limit. Use a DSU structure, iterate over the queries, for each
# query, iterate over any edges we have not visited previously and use
# them to update the DSU joining any groups that become available, once
# we do that, we know that if nodes a and b are in the same disjoint
# set, we can travel between a and b using edges with weight < limit.
#
# Time complexity: O(max(q, e)) - Where q is the number of queries and
# e is the number of edges, even though we have a nested for loop, we
# only visit each element of the inner loop once. The union call takes
# amortized O(1) time.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Both parents and rank arrays are size n.
