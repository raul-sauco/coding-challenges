import timeit

# When k is at least 2, we will be able to sort the input string
# completely, and return the smallest lexicographical string, we only
# need to handle the case when k == 1. In that special case, we can only
# rotate the string and have to check which is the rotation that leads
# to the smallest lexicographical string. Booth's algorithm computes
# that in O(n).

#
# Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) - Where n is the number of characters in
# the input. The case k == 1 can be solved in O(n) but the more general
# case requires sorting the input.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Sorting in python can take up to n/2 space.
#
# Runtime: 57 ms, faster than 65.48%
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 39.29%
class Solution:
    # An implementation of Booth's algorithm from Wikipedia.
