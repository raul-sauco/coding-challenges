# We want to find the minimum distance to travel from a node to another
# in an unweighted directed graph, each node has edges to the following
# 6 nodes and some nodes have extra edges. BFS is a good option to
# travel the unweighted graph because we move one edge at a time and
# count the number of edges (rolls) we take until we land in the target.
#
# Time complexity: O(n^2) - Potentially, from each node we can reach
# any other node but bfs will travel only one path because we only
# enqueue a node the first time we see it. The board is n*n so n^2 cells.
# Space complexity: O(n^2) - The dictionary could end up having one
# entry per cell in the input, the queue can hold an entire level, which
# could be more than half the board, for example in a 3x3 board.
