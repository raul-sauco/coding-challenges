# Use a counter to store the count of each point that we add to the
# object. Use a dictionary to store a set of x coordinates that we see
# for each y coordinate.
#
# Time complexity add: O(1) - We add to a counter and a dictionary.
# Time complexity count: O(c) - Where c is the number of points at the
# same y axis than the input point. We will try to form one square with
# each point at the same axis y, and doing so takes O(1).
# Space complexity: O(n) - Where n is the number of points we add to the
# structure, for each point, we add one value to two dictionaries.
