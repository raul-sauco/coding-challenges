# We can optimize the previous solution and make all operations run in
# O(1) time if we use only one stack and keep both ints, one to know
# the index of the element that we are at currently, the other to
# determine how many steps forward we can move at this time.
#
# Time complexity: O(n) - Back and forward need to pop/push step
# elements between stacks, that is n where n is the value of steps.
# Space complexity: O(n) - Each call could result in one element added.
